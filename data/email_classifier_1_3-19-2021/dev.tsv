TW negotiated rate transactions play againt PR such as that listed below.. Nov 16,2000. California Power Plants Get Jolt. As Natural-Gas Supplies Are Cut. By Rebecca Smith. Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal. LOS ANGELES -- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their. limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp. curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity.. The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce. electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns. that an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is. putting the reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk.. That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.. burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to. shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were. constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel. flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than. gas and generally has been costlier.. In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San. Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow. new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies. last summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to. solve the problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now,. they're finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical. problem and into a gas problem.. One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single. fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a. comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas. and electricity affect each other. ""We don't just need new generating plants. and transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,"" said Terry Winter, chief. executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the. organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. ""You. can't look at these things in isolation."". The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,. San Diego Gas & Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful of. industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In. California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas,. and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating. plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns some of the. older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But it didn't. like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when they. burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power. plants here need to operate.. The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short. of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including. many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair. after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer.. What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to. begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and. not big power plants.. The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because. gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation,. but especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last. summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of. gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices. also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal. units to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8%. from a year ago.. ""Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,"" said. John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of. Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up in the Northeast, based. on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two weeks.. High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In. California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was. $228 per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the. price a year earlier."

Enron Industrial Markets has recently completed the first transaction for a new 60-day fixed price product for the lumber industry. Available for delivery in Houston and Dallas, the product is offered by Enron in the over-the-counter market and via Clickpaper.com, Enron's Internet-based transaction system dedicated to the forest products industry. The first transaction was completed via Clickpaper.com on March 14 with a major lumber buyer in the southern United States. This represents the first online fixed price transaction contract in the industry. With the growing volatility in the lumber industry, the availability of a long-term fixed price product provides companies with another opportunity to mitigate their exposure. Additionally, this transaction represents the convergence of Enron's increasing involvement in physical lumber transactions with our recognized expertise in financial risk management.. In addition, EIM has announced that it has completed its acquisition of the Quebec City, Canada newsprint mill and related assets from Daishowa Forest Products Ltd. In July 2000, Enron purchased Garden State Paper, a recycled newsprint mill located in Garfield, NJ. The acquisition of the Daishowa mill now positions Enron as the seventh largest producer of newsprint in North America. The Daishowa mill in Quebec City will now be called Papiers Stadacona. The new name has great historical significance to the local community in Quebec City. When Jacques Cartier first explored the mouth of the St. Charles River in 1535, the aboriginal people living there referred to the village as Stadacona. This is now the site of modern-day Quebec City.. Enron Freight Markets. In March, Enron Freight Markets (EFM) completed the acquisition of Webmodal, Inc to help launch the traditional intermediary transportation business. EFM also started its spot trading business and completed 981 transactions in its first month.. East Power Origination. On Tuesday, April 3, the St. Lucie County Commission voted 3-2 to approve the Midway Energy Center near Fort Pierce, Florida, which is a 510 megawatt peaking power plant.

Enron Canada. Ken Lay addressed a breakfast meeting of the Toronto Board of Trade on Wednesday, April 4, as part of the ""Power Breakfast Series"". His topic was ""Moving Forward with Electricity Deregulation."" Before his speech, the chairman of the Board of Trade commented that ""this was the best attendance ever"" at one of their breakfast meetings. After the meeting, Mr. Lay spoke with reporters from Reuters, the Globe and Mail, the National Post, and Report on Business TV emphasizing Enron's commitment to deregulation of the Ontario power market.. IN THE NEWS. JAPAN: Enron presents power plant plan to Japan government. TOKYO, U.S.-based Enron Corp on Wednesday presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a plant in Japan. The move brings Enron one step closer to realizing its plan to build a power plant with an initial capacity of two million kilowatts in Aomori prefecture.. ""We submitted our basic plan to build the plant to the governor of Aomori prefecture today in line with last November's announcement,"" Tatsuro Seguchi, president of Enron Corp's Japanese affiliate Encom Corp, told a news conference. ""We are aiming to start construction of the plant in 2004 and start operations by 2007 since Japan's power market is one of our highest priorities,"" he said. 03/28/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001..

That position is now to be filled by Teri. Franklin. I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as. sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.. So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to. suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade. and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.. If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from. setting up deals with incorrect pricing. Which then causes us to have to go. back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the. error, which is exactly what I received an. email on earlier this morning.. Teri,.

21343	1	"SENDER START owner-nyiso_tech_exchange@lists.thebiz.net SENDER END SUBJECT START Re: NYISO - MC - Document from Stephen Fernands to MC Members SUBJECT END ""Stephen Fernands"" writes to the. NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:. Mark,. Thank you for your thoughtful response. I think you raise some valid. points, but I do not think they change the end conclusion.. Fundamental Value of ICAP. The principle of the ICAP market, as in any market, should be to reflect the. value of the underlying product that is being sold to the market. The. question is whether the product being sold, in this case ICAP, has truly. appreciated more then 400% since the previous ICAP auctions. Maybe - but I. doubt it.. AMP and Expected Revenue. The premise that changing the existing market mitigation rules to catch rule. breaking on a real time basis instead of a one day lag basis, although. plausible, seems fairly weak. It presumes that generation owners were. planning on violating the pre-existing screens and counting on the revenue. from those ""golden eggs."" Likewise, the link between ""expected energy. revenue"" and ICAP prices is tenuous at best. Generators are not limited to. receiving revenue from the spot market and may well choose to sell energy in. the bilateral market. In either case the goal of the generation owner is to. maximize revenue through all markets. The ICAP market, if functioning. properly, should reflect the value of the first call on the energy from the. generator by the NYISO and the ability of the NYISO to curtail external. transactions from that generator. For example two generation owners owned. two plants with the same characteristics. One generation owner did a. relatively ""good"" job selling a forward energy contract for the 6 month. procurement period while the other owner did a relatively ""poor"" job selling. a similar contract. In the ICAP auctions they both should have the same. strategy - maximize the revenue that each of them can receive out of the. ICAP auction. Any other strategy by either of the plants will lead to. overall lower profits.. Price Cap Load Bidding (I won't comment on if Virtual Bidding were in place. because it isn't going to be). Price Cap Load Bidding has been available in the past, only know it is. expanded slightly to Zonal Price Cap Load Bidding. This is not a. significant change to the existing rules and would seem unlikely to account. for either a significant change in the expected energy revenue or the. underlying value of the ICAP product.. ""...significant uncertainty to the New York market..."". I would agree that all of the rule changes including the Penalty and Public. Disclosure Proposal made it difficult for generation owners to properly. evaluate the effects of selling ICAP into a 6 month market. For this. reason, as well as the other possible reasons listed on my letter, I believe. that mitigating measures should be evaluated. I am not passing judgment at. this stage, but feel that all parties should know that the prices that were. posted are in the process of being reviewed and that subsequent changes may. be required to some or all of the months.. Next Steps. If the MMU determines that there was economic and/ or physical withholding,. whether due to regulatory uncertainty in surrounding control areas or. internal uncertainty about the exact effects of the AMP, I believe that it. is most appropriate for the MMU to take immediate action and refer it to the. committees for longer term resolution..

Latest Findings from Meridien:. 1. From Policy to Practice: Privacy Management Solutions. (Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=819. This is the third Meridien report in a series that deals with privacy issues worldwide. Advanced technology has made customer data more mobile than ever. Financial institutions analyze, transmit, and store sensitive customer data every day to deliver products and services to their customers in an efficient and effective manner. But technological advancements have also created an environment in which financial institutions can sell customer data to third parties or inadequately protect customer information. Regulators may stipulate which data can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance these demands. This report defines privacy management and examines three vendors offering privacy management middleware solutions.. 2. XML: Are We Speaking the Same Language?. (Wholesale e-Financial Client Access). (Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access). (Retail e-Financial Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=820. Technologists may not be uttering ""XML"" with quite the battle-cry zeal they did last year, but XML standardization efforts trudge on. XML remains a crucial consideration for organizations as they make their technology decisions. This report updates a previous Meridien report on XML, which focused largely on the business-to-business marketplace arena. Much of the immense market push in that direction has slowed along with the rest of the economy. In the meantime, belt-tightening and budget scrutiny are leading many institutions to pursue internal initiatives that can for now bring them more immediate and assured return on investment than might more outwardly focused, multi-institution efforts. This report updates some of the standardization efforts and provides some new coverage in an effort to shed light on the areas where the financial industry will more than likely focus in the next several years.. 3. Buy-Side OMS: Several Steps Closer to STP. (Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=823. Order management systems, or OMSs, facilitate the intrafirm processing of securities trading. The growth and acceptance of processing power and networking technologies have allowed OMSs to expand beyond simple order management. This growth has encouraged the centralization of several front-, middle-, and back-office and compliance functionalities into one solution. As straight-through processing becomes more important for firms, an OMS offers a relatively easy and proven way of starting down this road. This report examines the components of an OMS, various vendors providing OMS solutions, the OMS marketplace, and how a buy-side firm uses OMS technology.. 4. Top Ten Strategic IT Initiatives in Wholesale Financial Services for 2002. (Guest access). http://www.meridien-research.com/misc/top10_2002.asp. Meridien Research's third annual IT analysis identifies the top ten initiatives that will have key strategic importance for the wholesale financial services industry in 2002. This special report summarizes and forecasts spending on these initiatives, considering industry segment and geographic region.. 5. Top Ten Wholesale for 2002 Web cast.

79890	1	SENDER START mary.hain@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Transmission from Sierra Pacific SUBJECT END We are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for. LV Cogen. Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the. queue. We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't. detail here). Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it. resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue. At this time, we. are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if. we can't get the transmission service. It is my understanding that we have. exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue. I. would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve. this issue. However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing. due to the pending merger.. Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all. negotiating opportunities and that we can't file anything against Sierra.

191550	1	SENDER START wscholtes@aol.com SENDER END SUBJECT START (no subject) SUBJECT END Diana,. It's obvious that I am no longer useful to you besides as a baby sitter.. There is absolutely no love, respect or feelings for me whatsoever. I have. outlived my welcome. It appears that you have gotten everything you've ever. wanted and now are discarding me and our relationship. The horrible thing is. that I'm not sure how long this has been going on. It seems that every time. we have problems, I buy you something new and our relationship miraculously. heals itself. I now believe (and have probably always believed) that if I. wouldn't have decided to build the house, you'd have already left me. That's. a shame, because I will never forgive you for allowing me to sell MY home. (and the girls home) and then discarding our marriage sending me and my. family out into the streets without the most important material thing. Jennifer and Lindsay have ever had.. I look back at our 9 years of marriage, especially the last five years and. the only time I can remember truly being loved and appreciated was when you. were pregnant with Natalie. You blame me for not being as good to you as I. was when you were pregnant, but I say that you were the one who changed after. you had Natalie. Not that you weren't that way before you were pregnant, you. were just different during the pregnancy.. I''ve played this game much too long. I need to be loved, appreciated and. respected. I'm neither of those. I deserve better and maybe, since you are. obviously so unhappy, you do too.. I'm positive the effect on Natalie will be devastating. That's why we have. decided to drag this out this long. But our relationship, if you can call it. that, has degraded to a very low and dangerous point. That's why I have. decided to move into an apartment after the girls go home. I have already. been looking, I just need to decide where to move.. As for custody, I'm sure we will have differing opinions and we will have to. discuss them in person.. I would appreciate it if you could make some time over the next couple days. to discuss with me the timing of my move and discuss how we are going to. handle it with our parents, friends and mostly the kids.. Bitterly,. Bill Scholtes

186995	1	SENDER START arun.balasundaram@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Final Report SUBJECT END Hi everyone,. Thank you very much for the valuable business insight and active feedback on position manager during the past week. Based on the feedback from everyone we have made lot of changes in the new version of the application, which was released last week and I think the system is working to everybody's satisfaction. I would like to take this oppurtunity to sum up the features and options built inside the new position manager.. 1. All the west regions and basis have been rolled out.. 2. A feature has been added to the basis screen, which enables traders to paste the basis. points from excel.. 3. New curve types Capacity and Volatility Smiles are included.. 4. Positions can be viewed by both MWH and MW.. 5. Positions can be viewed by Delivery Points.. Currently we are working on fixing some problems in getting the curve shift and hopefully we will roll that out by the end of this week. We are also planning to add this application to the Enpower Launch Pad, which will make migration easier. I have noted down all the enhancement requests and we will try to get all those addressed in the next release.. Finally I would like to thank everyone on behalf of the entire risk team for devoting some time everyday to test this application. We are striving hard to end this and migrate this application to production in the near future.. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to call any of us listed below.

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the. room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday. afternoon.. He initially talked about ""can bring a horse to water, but can't make him. drink."". He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement. ($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex +. $49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside. Calif Utilities [includes PGE]). He said thought refunds in the hundred of. $millions or maybe $1billion were right.. His will propose the following method to the Commission.. 1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.. 2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in. NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, . incorporate NOx costs, add a 10% credit premium.. 3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to. questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).. He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset. against CAISO bills.. Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC (a). determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are. determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar. refunds, limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market. transactions.. We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these. issues to seek clarity.. Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to. calculate the refund liability? We may want to understand the risk under. different assumptions.. Thanks,. Jim"

Smutney-Jones did a good job responding to Rosenfeld's voter initiative. plan , but the headline and the front page only lead people to believe that. there's no alternative but going back to regulation -- and a state-owned. power authority at that (imagine!). It would have been very good to have. ARM get a mention as well -- but maybe it isn't ready to be public yet.. When the group does put a stake in the ground, it will have to be sure to. craft its messages in a way that avoids the appearance of reacting to. Rosenfeld rather than being the pro-active and pro-consumer ESP's.. I don't know if it's in your best interest, and I'd like to hear your. thoughts on this, but since the reporters are either being very biased or. not hearing enough from the pro-competition side, would an op-ed from Enron. help calm things down and give people a chance to hear about what positive. benefits a competitive market -- if allowed to exist -- can bring? I. thought the WSJ article on Monday was great, but few San Diegans read the. Journal and rely on the UT for their news. However, the editorial pages. are well read and may serve you well. I can help out your team on drafting. this if you're interested. Or if there's any other information gathering. you need, just let me know.. Anyway -- hope you had a good Thanksgiving and that you'll be able to come. down here soon.. Have a good Wednesday,. Dana. Dana Perino. dana@gablegroup.com. 619-234-1300 ext. 238

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS UPDATE. Bush Administration Issues Interim Rule Suspending Clinton Administration. ""Blacklisting"" Rule; Issues Proposed Rule Permanently Revoking Clinton Rule. and Reinstating Former Contractor Responsibility Provisions. On December 20, 2000, the Clinton Administration issued a final rule. addressing contractor responsibility which took effect on January 19, 2001.. 65 Fed. Reg. 80256 (Dec. 20, 2000) (the ""Clinton rule""). Federal agencies. are required to award contracts to ""responsible"" sources and contracting. officers are required to determine whether prospective contractors are. responsible before awarding federal contracts. The Clinton rule addressed. the procedures to be employed by a contracting officer in arriving at a. responsibility determination and under what circumstances contracting. officers may disqualify companies from contracting with the federal. government. The rule was extremely controversial and was effectively. overturned on April 3, 2001 by the Bush Administration, in a move that has. been described as a rebuff to organized labor and a nod to business.. Provisions of the Clinton Rule. ? The Clinton rule included a number of notable provisions:. o Added language stating that a ""satisfactory record of integrity and. business ethics"" included compliance with the law, including (for the first. time) tax, labor and employment, environmental, antitrust, and consumer. protection laws.. o Required contracting officers to consider all relevant credible. information, although the rule included guidelines for considering various. types of violations.. o Expanded the scope of a pre-award contractor certification to. require offerors to certify to additional violations (violations of tax,. labor and employment, environmental, antitrust and consumer protection laws). adjudicated within the last three years.. ? Although the rule contained certain procedural safeguards and had. its supporters, the rule was widely assailed by business groups and even by. some government officials for its broad scope.. Strong Criticism of the Clinton Rule. ? Businesses argued that the broad scope of the new regulations could. be used by contracting officers to improperly ""blacklist"" contractors from. doing business with the federal government. Detractors argued that under. the new rule, a contractor could technically be disqualified based on (among. other things) a relatively insignificant violation of law that did not. reasonably reflect the contractor's record of integrity or business ethics. or even based on unproven allegations set forth in civil or administrative. complaints by third parties, such as labor unions.. ? Businesses also expressed concern about a contractor's ability to. comply with the new certification requirement.. ? The Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR"") Council admitted that. the rule generated ""strong controversy"". According to the FAR Council, the. proposed rules generated 1,800 public comments (the typical FAR rule. generates only about 1% of that amount) and after the final rule was issued,. the FAR Council continued to receive negative comments. The Business. Roundtable, Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers,. Associated General Contractors of America, Inc., and Associated Builders and. Contractors, Inc. even filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the final rule.. The Bush Administration Responds. ? In response to enormous pressure, the FAR Council published an. interim rule which stayed the Clinton rule and reinstated the FAR text as it. existed prior to January 19, 2001 (although an arcane requirement of the. federal register requires that the stayed text retains its numbering and the. restored text is renumbered accordingly). 66 Fed. Reg. 17754 (Apr. 3,. 2001). The FAR Council provided in the interim rule that the stay will last. for 270 days from April 3, 2001 or until finalization of a proposed rule. that was concurrently published with the interim rule.. ? The proposed rule permanently revokes the Clinton rule and restores. the original FAR text. 66 Fed. Reg. 17758 (Apr. 3, 2001).. ? In both notices, the FAR Council indicated that it was. reconsidering its position and reassessing the advantages and disadvantages. of the December 20, 2000 rule. The FAR Council noted that it was not clear. whether there is justification for including the added categories of covered. laws in the rule and its implementing certifications, whether the rule. provides sufficient guidelines to prevent arbitrary or otherwise abusive. implementation or whether the final rule is justified from a cost benefit. perspective. The FAR Council also determined that the 30-day effective date. did not give contractors and the Government sufficient time to meet the new. obligations and responsibilities imposed by the new rule. The FAR Council. noted that the final rule has only been effect since January 19, 2001 and. there has not been time for the public to be in a position of reliance upon. the rule's existence.. ? Written comments related to the interim and proposed rules must be. submitted on or before June 4, 2001 to be considered.. If you have any questions about the new rules, please contact Michael. Charness at (202) 639-6780, Kathleen Little at (202) 639-6663, David Johnson. at (202) 639-6706 or Suzanne Reifman at (202) 639-6577.. ++++++CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE+++++.

On the open and after the first three hours of trading it sure looked like our forecast from Friday of a trending. market to the down side was going right. However on VERY light volume in the cash market the posture of the limited number of players was to trade sideways to up, in the last two hours. of the session. Today it was told that this was the lightest trading day on the Nasdaq and the second lightest on NYSC.. Where do we go from here? Frankly this one is a whole lot tougher to make a call than in the past. But lets look at the technical picture and see wants painting. First the Wave traders. needed to take out 1265.00 last week. Since there bias on the market was that it failed, then the new trend was down to long term support. How we see it at least for the moment.. Looking strictly at a old fashion technical forecast methodology. Today we had a conformation of a inverted head and shoulder with the right shoulder breaking out to the long side.. This formation was started 5/30 and completed today. Along with this a classic ""W"" formation. The defined high of 1319.00 on a channel breakout added credence to what we ""think"" might. be more upside momentum. And yes since our system did make a trend change to the long side we wanted to see from end of day data what may of confirmed the move.. For those of you who know me and we have spoken before. Then its no surprise for me to reiterate my (montra) about trading systems that are available to the retail public. Since I was. introduced to ""SYSTEM TRADING"" back in 1994.00 and have never looked back I more convinced that this is the only way to trade the futures markets for long term success. However I also. feel very strong that if anything is good in a computerized non subjective trading program and that if its going to have any real long term life to it, (then why would any one sell. it?) The fact is from my perspective that anything with real value is kept propritiary or its under management just as our system is.. I found this section in the June edition of Futures magizine, go to page #52 in the middle of the page is a obsevation from them on tracking systems. And I quote ""ALMOST ALL SUCCESSFUL. SYSTEMS THAT WE TRACK ARE LONGERTERM TREND FOLLOWERS OR EXTREMELY SHORT-TERM STOCK INDEX TRADERS. (THE CO- NSISTENT SHORT-TERM SWING SYSTEM HAS YET TO BE DEVELOPED.) Un quote. Well. folks the fact is yes it has been developed its just not for sale? I guess traders will just half to settle for being part of a managed acct with us and make some $$$.

For those potential clients that are following us one very important aspect of our system is that it feeds on a great deal of data that is transmitted from the cash market. And both. technical and cash data is calculated inorder to confirm trend changes.We have our computer models take a look back every hour on the half hour to re check if any trend changes have. been violated regardless of where the futures are.. What most of the retail public has is no idea that infact all the large firms both equity's and futures have there own (platforms) and there own (systems). Its been proven that as long. as one has a sound trading methodology that is coded and it can be looked and judged over long time frames, this is the ONLY way to make gains that can show year after year. Human. intervention has created more losses in the futures markets than I care to think of. It never fails that I talk to traders every day who pound there chest on what they did ""today"" but. whats more important is to look at what one has done over lets say a three year time frame. This is the secret for long term success.. On the E-mail that has been sent out in the last few weeks on the new market starting 8/21/2001 ""Single Stock futures"" This will be very exciting for us due to the fact that we will be. one of the first firms in the country to offer this new market in a Managed program with the underlying trading methodology stemming from computer based models. The large firms will. have access to this market first then the retail public will begin 12/21/2001. As long as there are no problems that surface with the CFTC and SEC then Dec looks good.. For those of you who are not aware of the back ground of our programmers they have a history in the Futures and Equity side of the industry from institutional firms that are all. computer based with there own trading programs.. Again for those traders who are not aware of this market we will be able to trade futures on single stock issues. For example IBM will have a contract that will have 100 shares in a. contract. And that will have a life of 90 days just like the current four trading contract months per year. For more details on this market see details below.. CBOE Create Joint Venture on Single-Stock Futures World's Two Largest Equity Derivatives Exchanges to Create For-Profit Company CBOT to Join With Limited. Stake CHICAGO, May 14, 2001. - The world's largest options exchange and the largest futures exchange in the U.S. are teaming up to introduce a highly anticipated new product - single-stock futures contracts. The. Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) today signed a letter of intent to create a joint venture to introduce single-stock futures, following. approval by the boards of directors of both exchanges. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also agreed to participate in the joint venture with a limited stake. Legislation signed. into law in December will allow the introduction of single-stock futures by U.S. financial exchanges later this year, after an 18-year prohibition on the products. ""Today's. announcement highlights the innovation and entrepreneurial spirit among Chicago's exchanges,"" said CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Brodsky. ""This exciting new. initiative combines the best of securities and futures trading. Our willingness to work together on this venture will ensure that Chicago remains the world's center in derivatives. trading and risk management."" ""The creation of this joint venture recognizes the tremendous synergies of CME and CBOE, making us a formidable competitor in the global marketplace for. single-stock futures,"" said CME Chairman Scott Gordon. ""Our complementary customer bases of retail and institutional investors will benefit from the efforts of all three Chicago. exchanges to establish deep pools of liquidity in these products."" ""I am enthused that Chicago's exchanges have worked so well together to understand and address our customers' needs. and our members' concerns,"" said CBOE Vice Chairman Mark Duffy. ""We have designed a product that, I believe, will appeal to our customers, and a business structure that will provide. great benefit to our members."" ""Our largest customers have emphasized the importance of collaboration between the CBOE and CME to combine the capabilities, distribution and. connectivity of the futures and securities worlds,"" said CME President and Chief Executive Officer Jim McNulty. ""This alliance should also provide the highest level of capital. efficiency for our customers who trade in both futures and options."" ""The CBOT is pleased to work with the leadership of CBOE and CME in this initiative to bring this exciting new. product to our markets,"" said Nicholas Neubauer Chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade. ""The involvement of our members and the access to our customers will make important. contributions to the success of this venture."" The joint venture will be a for-profit company, will have its own management and board, and will be separately organized as a regulated. exchange. Single-stock futures will be traded electronically, and orders may be entered through both the new CBOEdirectTM electronic platform and CME's GLOBEX?2 electronic trading. system. CME and CBOE officials said they are engaged in negotiations with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), which clears all CBOE transactions, to clear the new products. McNulty. said the negotiations contemplate CME becoming a special clearing member of OCC to provide access for CME clearing members who are not members of the OCC. The exchanges anticipate. contracting with Designated Primary Market-Makers (DPMs) in these products and expect that the board appointed to govern the joint venture will determine the eligibility criteria,. selection process, rights, privileges and duration of such arrangements. Single-stock futures are expected to bring new efficiencies to securities trading, securities lending and. corporate hedging activities. CME and CBOE officials said they also expect to develop rules that would accommodate block trading and exchange-for-physicals (EFPs). The Chicago Board. Options Exchange created and launched the first listed options on stocks in 1973 and the first index options in 1982. Today, CBOE lists options on more than 1,500 stocks and on over 40. indexes, such as the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial AverageSM, the Russell 2000, the Nasdaq-100, and the S&P 100. It remains the world's largest and most successful options. marketplace. Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. launched the first successful stock index futures contracts on the S&P 500 in 1982. Today, CME trades futures and futures options on. indexes including the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000, FORTUNE e-50? , S&P/BARRA Growth and Value Indexes, and Nikkei 225, as well as its electronically traded E-mini. S&P 500 and E-mini Nasdaq-100 contracts - the fastest growing products in the exchange's history. CME also trades interest rate, foreign currency and agricultural commodity products.. On November 13, 2000, CME demutualized and became a for-profit, shareholder-owned corporation. CBOE is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CME is regulated by. the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additional information about the CBOE and CME can be found at their respective Web sites: www.cboe.com and www.cme.com..

A weekly publication from the. California Manufacturers & Technology Association. detailing legislative and regulatory developments in Sacramento. FRIDAY THE 13TH SURPRISE FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES. The budget impasse will keep lawmakers working over the weekend. In addition, a deadline looms for a vote on the Governor's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to keep Southern California Edison (SCE) out of bankruptcy. The Assembly and Senate Democrats are making a final run at their own versions of the plan. A Senate version is still in the works, while the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability will hold an informational hearing Saturday afternoon on ABX2 82 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek). ABX2 82 currently allocates the SCE undercollection almost entirely to noncore customers (above 20kw), pays SCE two times net book value for transmission, and leaves open the possibility of a contribution from SCE above the $400 million tax refund provided in the Governors MOU. The sketchy outline of a Senate plan would impose all undercollections to noncore customers, impose a $300 million haircut to generators and an additional $800 million from SCE.. Direct access rights would be suspended under ABX2 82 until 2003 and a study would be authorized by March 31, 2002, on how to expeditiously phase in direct access for customers over 20kw (and green direct access under 20kw).. Some of California's largest businesses have already been hit with rate increases over 100%. CMTA supports an equitable sharing of the costs of the SCE undercollection (as well as DWR contract costs) among all customer groups, and will oppose a solution to the SCE problem that unfairly shifts these costs to California businesses.. MORE OR LESS ENERGY. There seems to be no shortage of bad business bills making their way through the Legislature. Issues range from imposing strict liability on generators that reduce or discontinue electricity generation, to subjecting generators to felony criminal penalties for making basic cost/benefit business decisions.. Generator Liability. A measure, ABX2 51 (Reyes D-Fresno), that makes an electricity generator strictly liable for any damages that are proximately caused when the generator reduces or stops generating electricity for economic reasons, passed (7-0) from the Assembly Judiciary Committee on July 3, 2001.. Since negligence and intent need not be proven in order to establish strict liability, under ABX2 51, a generator could be held strictly liable for damages that resulted if electricity supplies were curtailed when the generator was temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance, unscheduled maintenance or due to other external business factors. ABX2 51 also would make it difficult for a generator to permanently close a facility, even if the facility was not operating profitably.. Despite the fact that electricity shortages are driven by any number of factors within and beyond their control, ABX2 51 would result in generators shouldering all liability and responsibility for electricity shortages.. CMTA will be actively advocating against this measure before it is heard on the Assembly Floor.. Felony Fuel Shortages. ABX2 65 (Cardoza D-Merced) is a vaguely worded measure that does not explicitly identify what types of activities would be considered felonious. The measure allows an individual or entity to be prosecuted for ""creating a fuel shortage"" defined as: (1) The diminution by contrivance or artificial means of any of the supply of fuel to a point below that needed to meet consumer demand;. (2) Restricting output or withholding capacity from bidding into the market; and,. (3) Economic withholding by submitting bids at prices above the producers' marginal cost.Fluctuations of in-state and out-of-state generation; maintenance of facilities; weather; customer demand; and drought are just a few of the many components that converge to impact day-to-day energy supplies. ABX2 65 does not allow for the natural swings in supply and demand which are common in a market economy, and add one more unpredictable component to the market, thus further complicating price and supply fluctuations.. In addition, the bill provides that producers only should receive marginal costs for their products. This precept flies in the face of a free market economy. Businesses should be able to receive a reasonable return on the products they produce and supply. Limiting a business' profits to marginal costs only further discourages investment in the State's energy infrastructure.. Second, entities already may be prosecuted for illegal business practices, conspiracy, collusion and intentional market manipulation under the State's Cartwright Act and the Federal Sherman Anti-Trust Act, among others. Enforcement of existing state and federal laws is sufficient to address the alleged illegal business practices the bill purports to remedy.. Third, the measure establishes that a person or entity who violates provisions of the bill is ""guilty of a felony and may be punished in state prison and a fine not to exceed 10 percent of the corporation's gross corporate assets."" These fines and penalties are excessively punitive.. Fourth, the bounty-hunter provisions of the bill provide an incentive for employees and interest groups to investigate businesses for profit. Other bounty-hunter legislation passed by the Legislature has resulted in many frivolous lawsuits. Some of the costs associated with these suits are absorbed by businesses and some of the costs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In any event, the bounty-hunter provisions have the potential to unnecessarily increase energy costs. The regulatory branch of our government already has the authority to investigate alleged unfair business practices. This authority should not be passed on to employees and interest groups.. ABX2 65 establishes a terrible precedent and has the very real potential to reduce existing energy supplies and to discourage future energy infrastructure investment within the State.. Office of Ratepayer Advocate. Following the charge of Pacific Bell, CMTA and other business lobby groups have successfully slowed the progress of SB 201 (Speier D-Hillsborough) which repeals the sunset of the Office of Ratepayer Advocate (ORA). CMTA does not oppose the continued existence of the ORA, but is advocating against language inserted into the measure that significantly expands the ORA's authority.. The ORA has exercised broad authority to supervise and regulate utilities, arguably beyond the authority it was granted when it became a stand-alone office. While there is ample legislative history in Public Utilities Code Section 309.5 indicating that the ORA should be independent of the Commission, the PUC's full authority was not automatically extended to the ORA.. CMTA joined Pacific Bell in proposing amendments to limit the ORA's authority and to require the PUC to issue written orders when ruling on the ORA's discovery requests. Written rulings by an Administrative Law Judge or Commissioner would provide additional information to the ORA, utilities and the public explaining the basis for decisions.. In addition, CMTA supports requiring the ORA to pursue alternative dispute resolution prior to filing a complaint. Many courts today utilize alternative dispute resolution because it often leads to a more efficient disposition of cases.. CMTA also is supportive of extending, for five more years, the sunset in the bill that the author seeks to repeal. Extending the sunset will allow the Legislature to assess whether or not the original intent of the legislation has achieved its purpose.. SB 201 failed passage in Utilities and Commerce on July 9, 2001 when the author resisted amendments to narrow and clarify provisions in the bill. Reconsideration was granted and the measure received a necessary rule waiver to allow the bill to be heard, again, by the Utilities and Commerce Committee on July 16, 2001.. ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE PASSES UI BENEFITS BILL. SB 40 by Senator Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) passed out of the Assembly Insurance Committee on July 11 on a 10-5 partisan vote. The bill would increase the cost of unemployment insurance (UI) to employers by more than $3.2 billion over four years and provides no systemic changes to help offset the cost. CMTA and other employer representatives opposed the bill.. An increase in unemployment benefits is a direct payroll tax that would be funded entirely by employers. According to the Employment Development Department's (EDD) projections, SB 40 as proposed would raise employer contributions over and above the existing rates by $160 million by 2004, given there are no changes in the unemployment rate. Further, it is estimated that by 2005, the total employer UI tax increase would jump to $782 million, a 32 percent tax increase. SB 40 would increase the maximum weekly benefit from the current level of $230 to $325 in 2002, to $373 in 2003, to $384 in 2004 based on state average weekly wage estimates.. The bill contains several other provisions that add costs to employers such as an alternate base period using the most recent 52 weeks of the benefit year that will allow six to eight percent more applicants to qualify for UI benefits. This would be a new system in addition to the current quarterly reporting system and would impose a new burden on employers who would have to manually report alternate base period wage information to EDD within ten days or pay a $250 civil penalty. It would also entitle employees who leave their job during a trade dispute caused by a reduction in wages and employees locked-out of work by the employer during a collective bargaining dispute to receive UI benefits anyway.. The federal Worker Adjustment and Renotification and Training Act (WARN) requires an employer of 100 or more employees to give at least a 60-day notice in plant closings or mass layoffs affecting 50 or more employees. If the employer fails to provide a WARN notice, they are liable for civil damages in the amount of 60 days of back pay and benefits to each affected worker. Some employers elect to not give the advance notice and pay the 60 days and benefits in order to avoid possible problems with product quality, equipment sabotage, poor attendance, injuries and etc. However, the upside to this decision is that employees get 60 days in which to look for work full time with full pay and benefits. SB 40 would allow these employees to collect UI benefits during the same 60 days.. California's UI maximum weekly benefit of $230 is the fifth lowest in the nation and has not been increased since 1992. However, California has the most liberal eligibility requirement of any state by almost any measure and in order to maintain any reasonable control on UI cost, the historical trade-off has been workers receiving lower benefits. The above provisions are good examples of how the system can be abused and must be resisted by employers.. CMTA along with other employer representatives are in serious discussion with the proponents of SB 40 to determine how to increase the benefit level and make some modest systemic changes that will help avoid placing an undue hardship on employers. Further discussions are being scheduled.. STORMWATER BILL PUT OVER. Late last week, Senator Kuehl's office circulated a negotiated compromise on the stormwater monitoring bill, SB 72 (Kuehl D-Santa Monica). Based on that version, the business community and the municipalities were prepared to remove their opposition earlier this week in the Assembly Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials Committee. However, the evening before the hearing, the bill's sponsor, Heal the Bay, circulated a new set of amendments to Committee members. Their version deletes several sections of the bill, including carefully crafted language intended to preserve and strengthen group monitoring programs. It also creates the potential for expanded monitoring requirements for industrial facilities.. Heal the Bay's action created an atmosphere of confusion and frustration that lead Senator Kuehl and Committee Chair Hannah-Beth Jackson to hold the bill in committee. In all probability, a rule waiver will be secured for an August hearing in Assembly Toxics. In the meantime, discussions will resume on Heal the Bay's proposed changes. CMTA remains hopeful that the outstanding issues mentioned above can be resolved without sacrificing the progress achieved over several weeks of negotiation.. CMTA ADVOCATES FOR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION FUNDING. CMTA has formally urged that $100 million dollars be allocated in the State Budget for Career and Technical Education (CTE, also known as vocational education). At the outset of this session, legislative leaders stated that CTE was one of the highest education priorities for the year. Unfortunately, the Governor eliminated funding for CTE in the May Revise and the Budget Subcommittees subsequently funded only $10 million for an unallocated fund.. In the past decade, more than half of the career technical education programs faced closure in the Los Angeles Unified School District because of lack of funding and support; statewide, the trend has been the same. Without new funding this year, more programs will close. The acquisition of marketable skills in high school offers students, both those who are college bound and those who will immediately enter the workforce, the opportunity to earn high salaries and engage in meaningful careers. CMTA continues to support legislation designed to rebuild California's CTE/vocational education system.. UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. A recent report from the California Department of Finance confirms that the state's economy does not seem destined to repeat its extraordinary 2000 performance this year. Employment growth slowed significantly during the first five months of 2001. The slowdown is principally centered in the San Francisco Bay Area due to the dramatic contraction in internet-related service industries. Below are data supporting the report's conclusions:. California's employment picture has changed notably since the end of 2000. In May, industry employment grew by 3,200 following gains of 19,400 in April and nearly 58,000 in March. Thus far in 2001, industry employment has expanded by an average of 12,500 jobs each month compared to an average of 49,000 jobs each month in 2000.. Despite decelerating job growth, California is still the nation's growth leader. While the state added over 3,000 jobs in May, nationally nonfarm employment fell by 19,000. Since the beginning of the year, California has accounted for 73 percent of the nation's new nonfarm jobs.. California's unemployment rate was unchanged in May at 4.9 percent. The rate a year ago was 5.0 percent. While still low by state and national standards, the unemployment rate of all San Francisco Bay Area counties rose in May.. Computer services-heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area-are bearing the brunt of the employment slowdown. Business service employment-which includes computer programming and personnel supply services-grew by nearly 13,000 jobs per month in 2000 but has averaged only 800 a month thus far in 2001. Within business services, the growth rate of computer services employment has been cut in half. Year-over-year industry employment growth in the San Jose Metropolitan Area-the Silicon Valley-has dropped from 5.9 percent in December 2000 to 1.3 percent in May 2001. Growth in the San Francisco Metropolitan Area over the same period dropped from 4.7 percent to 2.6 percent.. California's real estate market is also cooling. Home sales have moderated and prices in the state's costliest region, Santa Clara County, have softened. Statewide sales of single-family homes in May were off nearly 13 percent from one year ago. However, the median price of a single-family home in May was still up 10.7 percent from a year-ago.. Preliminary General Fund agency cash for June was $432 million below the 2001-02 May Revision forecast of $7.926 billion. Year-to-date, revenues are $389 million lower than the $78.781 billion that was expected.. www.cmta.net. California Manufacturers & Technology Association. 980 9th Street, Suite 2200.

To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. helen rucoba

118236	0	"SENDER START soblander@carrfut.com SENDER END SUBJECT START (01-137) Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm) SUBJECT END Notice # 01-137. April 20, 2001. TO:. All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms. FROM:. Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President. RE:. Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm). DATE:. April 19, 2001. ==. Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number. of rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the. implementation of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with. the CFTC and thus may become effective at any time, will be implemented. upon the launch of enymexK.. An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange's. website. A hard copy ""black-line"" version of the rule changes, which shows. changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson. at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange's Legal Department.. The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,. accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and. a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.. Trading Rules. A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the. roll-out of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX. ACCESS7 and enymexK. For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has. been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.. EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange's rules that. respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded. only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts. These rules. will now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.. Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (""enymexK Settlement Price. Procedures"") was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for. electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement. prices generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee,. or if the Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using. the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee. However,. one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no. settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid. or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25). contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available. for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading. By. comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would. allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and. offers that would be protected in the settlement!. process.. Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting. With regard to the four. physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX. Rules 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months. and a spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.. Also, the Exchange's current hedge exemption procedures will be made. applicable to the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled. enymexK contracts, the rule amendments provide for position accountability. across all contract months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a. reporting level of 25 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same. reporting level currently used for many other Exchange contracts. However,. NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding. possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these. reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cash-settled contracts.. Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage,. new Rule 9.04A (""enymexK Trading"") permits brokerage to be done for enymexK. products. Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member. will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it. carries, even if there is a system malfunction.. Arbitration Rules. The Exchange's arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Member. enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a. Non-Member enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be. subject to Exchange arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory. basis.. Summary Disciplinary Procedures. The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member. enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system.. Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a. summary disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action. when necessary on an expedited basis.. Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue. to be subject to Exchange rules.. If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact. Christopher K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX. Legal Department, at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate. General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207..

Stocks trended slightly lower this morning as investors remained. indecisive on a day devoid of any significant news headlines. On. the economic front, revised 2Q non-farm productivity was. basically in line with expectations, but much higher than 1Q.. Technology shares were lower, extending the downtrend from. Europe after a pessimistic analyst report hit telecommunication. stocks.. As of 11:54 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down. 0.05%, with the Nasdaq Composite Index giving up 1.1%. For the. second straight day, health care and pharmaceutical issues led. advancers, while banks led the decliners.. Shares of Walgreen Co. (WAG,36,f2) led drugstore retailers. higher after reporting that August sales at stores open at least. a year rose 11.6% from the year-ago period, while total August. sales rose 17.2% from the same period. Most of the increase was. in pharmacy same-store sales, which were up 17.5% in August,. year-over-year.. Shares of Genentech Inc. (DNA,45,f2) drifted lower despite the. company's report that the Food and Drug Administration had. approved its Cathflo Activase product aimed at dissolving blood. clots that frequently occur within catheters inserted into veins. to dispense medication. Genentech emphasized that Cathflo. Activase is the only thrombolytic product available to address. catheter complications.. Brokerage stocks were higher after UBS Warburg upgraded its. rating on a number of stocks in the group. Warburg believes that. 3Q will mark the trough for many of theses companies.. -. TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY. Bonds were mixed, but mostly flat, as the stock market's. indecisive action provided few cues for Treasury investors.. Bonds were trading slightly higher after the release of this. morning's 2Q revised non-farm productivity data from the. Department of Labor showed a 2.1% annualized gain. The number. was slightly above the Dow Jones Newswires forecast of a 2.0%. gain, but below the original 2Q report of a 2.5% increase.. Productivity growth for 1Q had been reported as a mere 0.1%.. Revised unit labor costs for 2Q rose 2.7%, in line with the. Street's mean forecast, but higher than the previously reported. 2.1% increase as inflation adjusted hourly compensation rose. 1.7%. However, the figures are much lower than 1Q's 5% increase.. Productivity gains were enhanced over 1Q largely owing to a. reduction in hours worked as companies quickly cut staff in. reaction to the economic slowdown. This latest increase in. non-farm productivity is closer to the recent average of. approximately 2.5% growth for the five years prior to 2001.. In other economic news, a report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. showed that announced job cuts in August fell 32% to 140,019. from July's 205,975. The telecommunications sector bore the. brunt of most of the layoffs, continuing the recent trend. The. three-month moving average rose to 470,000, with total announced. job-cuts rising to 1,123,356 for 2001.. -. WORLD MARKETS. The Bloomberg European 500 Index drifted lower, down 1.43% as of. 11:54 a.m. EDT. Ericsson (ERICY,3.91,f1), Marconi. (MONI,1.16,f1), and Alcatel SA (ALA,13.49,f2) led the decline in. the telecommunications sector after Merrill Lynch forecasted a. further drop in spending on mobile-phone networks. Alcatel. accentuated the pain when it said that meeting its full-year. earnings forecast would be difficult. The euro was flat against. the U.S. dollar, conceding earlier gains as traders booked. profits on a slow news day. Meanwhile, the British pound was. higher versus the buck after some positive economic reports. suggested that the British economy could be on its way back.. British retail sales for August rose at the fastest pace in. almost five years, while housing prices rose again, extending a. recent trend.. William Johnson, Market Analyst. #.

E X T R E M E M A R K E T C O M M E N T A R Y. _. The STOCK INDEXES closed higher on Monday as they extended last. Friday's short covering rallies. Light support came from biotech. stocks however trading was rather light. Session highs in the. September S&P 500 index fell short of filling last Wednesday's gap at. 1278.50 as the rebound off last week's low still appears corrective. in nature. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq did fill last week's gap but closed. below the opening range leaving the door open for a possible setback. on Tuesday. Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that. additional weakness near-term is possible. If the declines resume,. May's reaction lows are potential targets.. The Dow managed to close higher on Monday led by gains in oil stock. thereby confirming last Friday's key reversal up. If the Dow can post. a higher weekly close it could set the stage for a resumption of this. spring's rally later this month.. INTEREST RATES September bonds extended last week's breakout above. this spring's downtrend line crossing near 100-26, which confirmed. that a bottom has been posted. Much of today's strength was due to. comments made by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan Sunday night that he. sees few signs of inflationary pressure. Downward pressure in the fed. fund futures indicates that there is nearly a 100% chance that the. Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates by 25- basis points. at the June 26-27 meeting. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling. that sideways to higher prices into early-June are possible. If the. rally continues, May's high crossing at 102-22 is September's next. target.. The CRB INDEX posted a potential downside reversal on Monday due to. weakness in grains, meats, precious metals, fiber and crude oil. products. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's. bearish reversal pattern. The rebound off last week's low that spiked. below April's low was to be expected due to light short covering.. Closes below last week's low crossing at 208.43 would confirm a. downside breakout of this spring's trading range thereby renewing its. decline off January's high.. ENERGY MARKETS were mostly lower on Monday despite the fact that Iraq. made good on its threat to cut oil exports unless it receives a. six-month extension of the oil-for-food deal. The late-session sell. off was triggered by questions over Iraq's resolve to halt crude oil. exports for any significant length of time.. July crude oil closed higher on Monday but near session lows as early. strength faded into the close. If the decline off May's high. continues, the 50% retracement level of the December/May rally. crossing at 27.51 is July's next target. Momentum indicators are. bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is possible.. July heating oil posted a downside reversal on Monday and closed. below the 38% retracement level of the December/May rally crossing at. 75.66. Closes below last week's low of 75.10 would renew the decline. off May's high and set the stage for a test of May's reaction low. crossing at 74.55, which coincides with the 50% retracement level of. this spring's rally.. July unleaded gas posted a huge key reversal down on Monday despite. news that Iraq has halted crude oil exports. However, today's action. indicates that traders do not believe that the crude oil embargo by. Iraq will have long- lasting effects on the market. In recent. weeks-unleaded gasoline supplies have risen enough to temper concerns. over summer gasoline supplies. Additional weakness on Tuesday along. with a close below 90.30 would renew July's decline off May's high. thereby opening the door for a possible test of April's gap crossing. at 87.25 later this month.. July Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday due weather. forecasts, which are calling for above normal temps across Texas this. week along with revised predictions for warmer weather in July and. August. Additional support came from indications that industrial. demand is on the rise following this spring's decline. Momentum. indicators are oversold hinting that a short covering bounce is. possible during the first half of June.. CURRENCIES The September Dollar managed to close higher on Monday. after early weakness failed to fill last week's gap at 118.62.. Additional strength on Tuesday would set the stage for a possible. test of weekly resistance that crosses at 121.58 later this month.. The daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) is bullish signaling that. additional weakness is possible.. The September Swiss Franc closed slightly lower on Monday hinting. that the corrective bounce off last week's low might be ending. The. recent breakout below support crossing at .5643 has opened the door. for a test of weekly support crossing at .5508 later this month. The. daily ADX (a trend- following indicator) remains in a bearish trend. mode.. The September Canadian Dollar posted a quiet inside day with a lower. close due to light profit taking on Monday. September remains poised. to test trading range resistance crossing at .6541. Multiple closes. above this resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout and. renew the rally off April's low. Momentum indicators are bullish. signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first half of. June are possible.. The September Japanese Yen was lower on Monday due to light profit. taking. However, it remains above trading range resistance crossing. at .8425 thereby leaving the door open for additional gains. near-term. If the rally continues, gap resistance crossing at .8625. is September's next target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling. that additional gains are possible.. PRECIOUS METALS August gold closed lower on Monday as it is poised to. renew its decline off May's high. Last week's trendline breakout has. opened the door for additional weakness near-term with the reaction. low crossing at 263.20 being the next likely target. Stochastics and. RSI are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible.. July silver resumed its decline on Monday and is poised to test May's. low at 4.315 later this week. Multiple closes below this support. level would confirm a breakout and open the door for a likely test of. weekly support crossing at 4.15 later this month. Momentum indicators. are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term is likely.. July copper closed steady on Monday following a spike below May's low. at 74.75 earlier in the session. A short covering bounce ahead of the. close erased early session lows leaving the door open for additional. short covering on Tuesday. Multiple closes below today's low would. confirm a breakout of this spring's trading range while opening the. door for a test of weekly support crossing at 74.10 later this month.. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to lower. prices near-term are possible.. GRAINS July corn posted an inside day with a lower close. Weakness. was tied to forecast that call for warmer and dryer weather. conditions across the Midwest later this week. Additional pressure. came from spillover selling from wheat and today's disappointing. export inspection report that came in at 17.595 verses 32.383 million. bushels. However, losses were limited due to expectations for a. decline in this afternoon's crop conditions report due to the. cool/wet weather, which continues to dominate Midwest weather. The. latest condition report shows that 7% is rated poor/very poor, 29% is. fair, and 64% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last. week's levels and should provide light support in overnight trade and. possibly on Tuesday. Last week's breakout above May's downtrend line. signals that a short-term bottom has been posted. If the rebound. continues, May's high at 2.11 1/2 is July's next upside target.. July wheat plunged lower on Monday filling last Friday's gap and. erasing over half of last week's gains due to improving weather. conditions across the Plains. Warmer and drier conditions are. expected to speed up the winter wheat harvest while rain is. forecasted for Montana and western Canada, which have been dry.. Moisture is also forecasted for dry parts of China this week. Today's. sell off took much of the wind out of the bulls sails as the market. has been unable to clear May's downtrend line, which is needed to. confirm that a short-term bottom is in place. This afternoon's crop. condition report showed that 25% is rated poor/very poor, 36% is. fair, and 39% is rated good/excellent. This is a decline from last. week's level and could lead to a short covering bounce on Tuesday.. SOYBEAN COMPLEX July soybeans closed lower on Monday however, a short. covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses.. Session lows spiked below broken trading range resistance as the. market rechecked the recent breakout. Momentum indicators remain. bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices during the first. half of June is still possible. If the rally continues, March's high. crossing at 4.77 3/4 is July's next target. This afternoon's planting. progress report showed that 80% of the soybean crop has been planted. compared with the five-year average of 75%. The condition report. showed that 10% is rated poor/very poor, 34% is rated fair, and 56%. is rated good/excellent. I am look for July to trade steady to higher. on Tuesday.. July soybean meal posted an upside reversal on Monday as the market. continues to consolidate in a relatively narrow trading range. Closes. above 168 or below 159.60 are needed to clear up near-term direction. in the market. Strong domestic and export demand continues to offset. bearish weather forecast for the Midwest and portions of China.. LIVESTOCK August hogs posted an inside day with a lower close on. Monday due to light profit taking as it consolidated some of last. week's gains. Nevertheless, the door remains open for a test of. April's high crossing at 65.95 later this month. Much of today's. pressure was due to spillover selling from the limit-down close in. bellies. Losses were limited due to the steady to 75-cent higher cash. bids. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to. higher prices into early-June are possible.. August cattle closed lower on Monday on ideas that cash and boxed. beef markets may be topping. The relatively low volume of cash sales. last week indicates that there might be a larger showlist this week.. Momentum indicators are bullish but have become overbought warning. traders to use caution as a top may be near. While the door is still. open for a possible test of this year's high crossing at 75.00,. additional weakness on Tuesday could trigger a round of. long-liquidation.. FOOD & FIBER July coffee closed higher on Monday as it posted a key. reversal up due to short covering. Today's rally was triggered by. talk of possible cold weather moving into Brazil's coffee growing. regions later this week. Additional support came from the latest. commitments of trader's report, which showed that funds had. significantly reduced their long positions. Additional strength on. Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.. July cocoa closed lower on Monday as it extended last week's breakout. below trading range support crossing at 955. Momentum indicators. remain bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible. If the. decline continues, the 75% retracement level at 862 is July's next. target.. July sugar closed higher on Monday as it extended last Friday's short. covering bounce off the 38% retracement level of this spring's rally. crossing at 857. While another day or two of consolidation is. possible, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways. to lower prices are still possible. If the decline continues, fib. support crossing at 832 then 808 are targets.. July cotton posted a key reversal down on Monday but remains above. psychological support crossing at 40-cents. Early support came from. news of increasing crop losses across west Texas cotton due to. flooding. However, early strength failed to trigger follow-through. buying, which triggered a technical sell off into the close.. Additional weakness on Tuesday is needed to confirm today's bearish. reversal pattern, which could lead to a resumption of this spring's. decline later this month..

She has spoken with Scott Josie, apparently one of our business people, and has been advised that the December 27 closing is critical, due to market conditions. Theresa also believes that the December 27 date will be aggressive even for F&J, given the late date. Theresa, please let me know if I have mischaracterized what you said.. I see two options:. 1. If you agree with me that we can't sign the letter as is: I do my best to get an acceptable letter negotiated with Uriel Dutton today. If I can't, Mariner retains someone else today. Frankly, I am not optimistic about getting an acceptable letter from F&J, based on where F&J started.. 2. If you believe that we need to go ahead and get the best deal we can from F&J under the circumstances: I will do my best to get that done by noon or so, and if F&J doesn't budge, we may have to sign the letter as is.. Caveat: I don't know if Dutton is in the office this week, so he and I may not be able to communicate quickly. Also, if we redraft a letter, we will probably not have time to get comments back from all the other interested Enron attorneys.. I would also suggest telling Kelly Zelacovitz, Mariner's GC, this morning what our game plan is, and if it is option one, have her go ahead and contact her back-up choices of law firms, start running conflicts checks, etc., and have them be ready to hit the ground running.. If there is anyone else I need to send this e-mail to, please let me know.. I am in all day today; please let me know what you want me to do.. Britt

45484	0	"SENDER START jeff.dasovich@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START SUBJECT END Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals. In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus.. This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs.. In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business.. Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases.. But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout.. As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity.. Or maybe not.. While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled.. Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals.. Duress alleged. Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need.. ""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."". Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation.. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California.. ""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added.. ""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said.. Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis.. Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said.. Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place.. He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices.. ""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."". The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period.. ""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.. Willingness to deal. At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC.. The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis.. Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC.. For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts.. ""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."". Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements.. Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements.. ""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp.. The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California.. Sempra says contract fair. The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture.. San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state.. Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices.. ""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said.. But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources.. White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing.. ""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered.. ""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"". State authority buying more power for 2002. Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss. SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices.. Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year.. The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators.. Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run.. ""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports.. A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year.. Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are.. In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus.. Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member.. Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."". New contracts would increase 'green' power. In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said.. Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent.. The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages.. The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes.. Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February.. ""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group.. Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them. Even the state's businesses are critical.. They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there.. Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate.. Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system.. ""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.. The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis.. The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month.. ""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.''. Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state.. Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work.. ""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''"

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" Emmitt Smith, RB DAL -!.

""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01. According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.Eddie Kennison, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. Mike Anderson, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, bu!. t !. the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.David Patten, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.Troy Brown, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01. Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.Curtis Conway, WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.Freddie Jones, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01Jones !. ov!. ercame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.Larry Centers, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.Peerless Price, WR BUF - Free Agent . Updated 10/28/01Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.Matt Hasselbeck, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.James McKnight, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01. McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what !. th!. e opposition is.Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.Tony Banks, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.. Duce Staley, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday a!. t !. Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01. McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.Michael Pittman, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.David Boston, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.. Cowboys, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.Clint Stoerner, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in S!. un!. day's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.Emmitt Smith, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.Rob Johnson, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01. Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.More UpdatesView Transactions . . if (!random) {if (parent.random) {var random = parent.random} else {var abc = Math.random() + """"; var random = abc.substring(2,abc.length);}}. document.write('');. . . . . .

30513	1	SENDER START gavin.dillingham@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Calif. Gov. set to sign bill to cut power rates SUBJECT END UPDATE 2 - Calif. Gov. set to sign bill to cut power rates. (UPDATE: Changes lead to add comments from Gov. Davis spokesman). By Nigel Hunt. LOS ANGELES, Aug 31 (Reuters) - California Gov. Gray Davis will sign. emergency legislation to cut electricity rates in San Diego where a tripling. in customers' bills this summer has sparked a public outcry, his spokesman. said on Thursday.. The bill was passed by the California Assembly by 58 votes to 14 late. Wednesday. It needed 54 votes to secure the necessary two-thirds majority of. the Assembly's 80 members required for emergency legislation.. He is in favour of the Alpert/Davis bill. If he gets the bill next week I. suspect he will sign it sooner rather than later,'' said Davis' spokesman. Steven Maviglio, noting however that he was reserving judgment on a linked. measure to provide up to $150 million in state funds to help fund the price. cut.. The bill was passed by the state Senate on Tuesday. It is sponsored San Diego. Democrats state Sen. Dede Alpert and Assemblywoman Susan Davis.. Under rules governing the deregulation of California's power industry,. customers of Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE - news) unit San Diego Gas and Electric. are the first to pay free market rates without a safety net.. When California deregulated its power markets, rates were initially frozen. for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities. The rate freeze. was lifted for San Diego Gas and Electric customers last year.. Rates for the state's other two investor-owned utilities, San Francisco-based. PG&E Corp. (NYSE:PCG - news) subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric and. Rosemead-based Edison International (NYSE:EIX - news) unit Southern. California Edison, remain frozen.. The proposed legislation establishes a 6.5 cent per kilowatt hour cap on the. cost of energy for ratepayers, less than a third of the the current free. market'' cost of 20.8 cents. The cap would be retroactive to June 1, 2000.. Under the bill, the difference between rates paid by customers and the higher. market-based rates would initially be footed by the local utility, San Diego. Gas and Electric, which would create a balancing account.'' The shortfall. would then be recouped from customers at a later date.. San Diego Gas and Electric spokesman Doug Kline said the utility was urging. Davis to veto the legislation.. It is a well intentioned, but seriously flawed bill. It is like ordering a. shopkeeper to buy a loaf of bread for $2 and sell it to customers for 60. cents,'' he said.. The bill would cap prices through December 31, 2002 although the rate ceiling. could be extended through December 2003 if the California Public Utilities. Commission (CPUC) finds that it is in the public interest.. Kline said the utility has estimated the under-collected shortfall would. amount to around $726 million by the end of 2002. If it were extended for. another year that shortfall would climb to around $1 billion, he noted.. He said the bill, if approved, would impact the utility's credit ratings.. Wholesale prices in the state soared to record levels this summer and as San. Diego residents saw their bills skyrocket. There were reports that some. pensioners were even turning off their refrigerators in a bid to keep their. power costs down.. The CPUC, which regulates the state's power markets, held an emergency. meeting last week and voted for a partial cap which limited bills for. customers for their first 500 kilowatt hours per month of use.. But a plan for more extensive relief along similar lines to the Davis/Alpert. bill was defeated in a vote that split along political lines.. It has been estimated that the plan approved by the CPUC would result in a. much smaller shortfall of about $77 million.. The three commissioners who were appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson, a. Republican, backed the more modest relief plan, while the two appointees of. Davis, the current Democratic governor, sought more extensive rate cuts.. California's power problems are caused partly by increased demand linked to. the nation's booming economy, with Western states among those showing the. fastest growth.. There also have been few power plants built during the past 10 years and,. although many are now planned, the prolonged approval and construction. process means most will not come on line before 2002.

I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy. for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.. My thoughts are as follows:. 1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to. trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a. very blurry line.. 2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for. terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be. practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there. are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in. the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of. affairs. I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated. contracts outside a Master Agreement.. 3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined. simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or. the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater. term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make. sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.. I would be happy to discuss this with you further.. Alan

That is quite different from being. rash."" --George S. Patton. NVIDIA KEEPS CHIPPIN'. Nvidia has overtaken ATI Technologies as the largest maker of. graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers.. By Mike Trigg. Computer graphic chip maker Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) reported. better-than-expected third-quarter results after the market's. close yesterday, citing market share gains attributable to. original equipment manufacturers' (OEM) and system builders'. rapid adoption of its GPU technologies. The company maintained a. robust growth outlook, expanding out of its core desktop. business.. Nvidia's fiscal third-quarter (ended October 31) net income was. $28.1 million, or $0.35 per share, compared to $10.6 million, or. $0.15 per share, in the comparable period a year ago. The Street. consensus estimate called for the company to earn $0.32 per. share. Moreover, revenues came in at $198.2 million, more than. doubling year-over-year from $97 million. And operating income. grew 142% to $36.6 million.. According to a new study this week by Mercury Research, Nvidia. has overtaken ATI Technologies (Nasdaq: ATYT) as the largest. maker of graphic-enhancing chips for desktop computers. For the. third quarter, Nvidia chips were in 48% of all desktop. computers, increasing more than twofold from a year ago.. Meanwhile, ATI's desktop market share slipped five percentage. points to 34%. However, in the laptop market, ATI expanded its. market share from 29% in the same period a year ago to 57%,. highlighted by new contracts with IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell. (Nasdaq: DELL). Despite losing money in the last two quarters,. ATI expects to re-enter the black in the current quarter (ends. November 30). Nevertheless, Nvidia's gains continue to look. impressive in comparison to the competition.. The Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia has made significant gains. winning over longtime ATI customers, including Compaq Computer. (NYSE: CPQ) and Gateway (NYSE: GTW). According to the Street,. the shift has occurred because Nvidia has been more successful. at rolling out improved chips every six months. In a press. release yesterday, CEO and President Jen-Hsun Huang cited its. newest GeForce chip, the GeForce2 Ultra, as cause for its. expanding leadership position.. The other competitive force, 3Dfx Interactive (Nasdaq: TDFX), is. coming off a disappointing July quarter when revenue was less. than half of what the Street expected. The company attributed. the shortfall to component shortages and ""competitive and retail. seasonality factors."" Similarly, the company announced it would. report disappointing results for the quarter ending in October.. AFTER-HOURS COVERAGE. DELL ANNOUNCES Q3. Direct PC seller Dell announced third-quarter results after the. market's close today, in line with the consensus Street. expectation. With speculation throughout the day looming that. Dell had ""juiced"" revenue numbers at quarter's end, shares. traded down roughly 6% to close at $28.38. The company also. reconfirmed earlier guidance that called for sales to rise 27%. year-over-year, slightly below the 30% growth the company was. expecting earlier in the year.. FULL STORY>>. http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=189395. _. NEWS TO GO. Guess what? Sexy jeans retailer Guess (NYSE: GES) announced. third-quarter profits after the market's close well below Street. expectations, citing excess inventory and a difficult retail. environment. Guess reported third-quarter profits of $5.6. million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $14.2 million, or $0.33. per share, in the year-ago period. That's well below the Street. consensus expecting $0.36 per share. Inventory levels at. quarter's end were $164.2 million, up from $94.2 million last. year. Total revenue increased 39% year-over-year to $216.4. million. Guess also revised its fourth-quarter outlook, now. calling for earnings to be $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share.. The Street estimate called for $0.36 per share.. Construction and industrial supplies distributor Hughes Supply. (NYSE: HUG) reported that it would miss third-quarter and. full-year estimates. The company expects earnings between $0.75. per share and $0.79 per share, down from $0.87 per share in the. same period last year. The consensus Street estimate had called. for $0.93 per share. Sales for the quarter should come in at. $860 million, about 10% lower than expected. The company expects. full-year sales growth of 9% to 11%, and full-year earnings. between $2.75 per share and $2.80 per share. The. slower-than-expected growth was attributed to commodity pricing. exposure for many plumbing and building materials products.. You learn real good! Computer training company Learning Tree. International (Nasdaq: LTRE) posted solid fourth-quarter and. full-year results after the market's close yesterday. Learning. Tree reported earnings of $9.1 million, or $0.40 per share,. compared to $5.7 million, or $0.26 per share, one year ago.. That's well ahead of the Street consensus of $0.36 per share.. Moreover, the Orlando, Florida-based company pulled in $56. million in sales, increasing 21% from $48.5 million in the same. period last year. For the entire fiscal year, Learning Tree. earned $50.4 million, or $1.65 per share, compared to $14.7. million, or $0.57 per share, last year.. Managed healthcare service provider PacifiCare Health Systems. (Nasdaq: PHSY) reported a significant drop in third-quarter net. income, citing rising medical costs related to the company's. transition from capitated contracts to per-diem, fee-for-service. or shared-risk arrangements with hospitals. The Santa Ana,. Calif.-based company turned in earnings of $5.2 million, or. $0.15 per share, compared to $69.3 million, or $1.54 per share,. in the year-ago period. The Street consensus called for a. $0.07-per-share loss. Results reported for the quarter include a. $3.8 million credit, or $0.11 per share, related to the early. termination of a license agreement. Results for the same period. last year reflected a $1.7 million net charge, or a. $0.04-per-share loss, for impairment and disposition activities..

44203	1	"SENDER START steve.swain@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START RE: CA question SUBJECT END Before we carry this much further, let me explain some more why I raised the question in the first place.. We currently assume that our exposure to CTC going forward is zero. Arthur Andersen was questioning this assumption, as market prices in general are lower than embedded gen now (unless you include DWR costs), which implies that if we were under the old CTC regime we could be paying some positive CTC. AA was wondering why we weren't holding some reserves for this eventuality.. Mary Lynne and I told them we weren't reserving b/c we just have no clear idea what will happen in the coming months re:CTC, but that in all likelihood zero is the best guess b/c no one can agree on what PX credit (""market"" price) is now that there is no PX. Besides, though SCE and PG&E are arguing for different methods (the so-called ""top-down"" and ""bottom-up""), in the end the result will be about the same (CTC=0), especially now that PG&E has supposedly stopped ""adjusting"" the PX credit to recover past undercollections. And of course, the DWR contracts muddy the waters, since if one includes them in the calculation of utility gen costs, then you could easily get to a negative CTC situation. Bottom line: we think things are so screwed up that everyone will prefer just to ignore CTC for the few months remaining that it has to run.. In light of all this we thought we might further quell AA's skepticism if we could show that although we had once argued that DJI should be used as a substitute for PX credit, we were now simply arguing that DA should pay T&D only, and that CTC should become a relic of the past.. I think by now it may be a dead issue -- I believe AA has accepted our arguments w/o this extra bit of persuasion, else I would have heard more from Mary Lynne. Thanks for all the background and input from everyone, and please let me know if you have any more relevant comments given this context."

Here is the poem you requested.. Paranoid. Do you really care what I have to say?. Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway?. Should I sit here like a statue in stone?. Do I really like feeling so alone?. What did I do to the world to feel this way?. Why am I so paranoid everyday?. My mind lives in a constant shade of black. I always want to run and pack. To find a world that's all my own. Somewhere I can finally call home. But the fear remains with me. It's all I can see. Why does everybody stare?. Or even glare. They say it's all in my head. It's like I'm a ghost back from the dead. It's scary to be left alone. Even inside my own home. Everyone's out to get me. All after me. Now when you ask me what's wrong?. It takes me too long. To figure out. What the questions about. Do you really care what I have to say?. Are you going to end up ignoring me anyway?. Should I sit here like a statue in stone?. Do I really like feeling so alone?. ~~~~~MICHELLE MCVICKER 12/20/01~~~

Attention: Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts. Payable;. CORRECTED ISO ABA NUMBER: 121000358. ISO Account # 14897-03272. Third Notice - The ISO faxed the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices to. Market Participants yesterday afternoon.. However, the invoices did not contain the ABA number associated with wire. transfers to the ISO FERC Fee bank account.. Therefore, please use the following Bank Account information, if paying the. invoiced FERC Fee on a monthly basis.. ISO FERC FEE Account Information:. ABA # - 121000358. ISO Account # 14897-03272. ISO Settlements & Finance. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment. options for ISO Market Participants.. FERC Fee - Market Notice. Introduction. FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the. Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,. 2001. The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'. metered demand (load and export MWhs). The fee is currently estimated at. $0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that. do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.. In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the. ISO Tariff, 94 FERC ? 61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure. for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants. The. California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim. exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and. request that they be exempted from charges.. Process. One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,. the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each. market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data. sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions. for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total. balance outstanding. A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and. can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.. Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved. Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to. cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2. of the Tariff. For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an. annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those. payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after. FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.. Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO. Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual. basis. Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision. within one month of receiving your first invoice. Any SC payments received. by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account. Interest earnings. will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling. Coordinators.. A final invoice will be issued annually, by fax, after the FERC announces. the final rate after April 30 of the following year. This invoice will. contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load. and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the. year.. To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing. that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission. transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the. FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,. location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be. exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect. any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any. disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's. settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the. total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid. Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using. preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change. once the settlement's data is finalized. Market Participants will see the. revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data. sheet.. Timeline. The ISO will issue invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing. this afternoon. The process and timeline described above will begin with. the April Preliminary Invoice. The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will. contain invoices for January through April.. If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.. Client Relations Communication.

There is still no true arctic air in the pattern, but the Southern jet. stream is active for storms and the trend is certainly colder than recent. weeks.. We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last month.. January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable warmth in. the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record breaking. cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal over. the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I still. don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a ""cold and. stormy"" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this. morning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas. today with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast. through Thursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see. some light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker.. This should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The. coldest of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now.. This should start modifying although only in a gradual sense through the. rest of the week.. The same threats and questions raised yesterday in the 6-10 day outlook. still apply today. The Canadian and European schemes still look sharper. with the western ridge and eastern trough than their American counterpart.. The correct forecast up to now most of the time was to go with the warmer. solution. This time I am running with the colder one. The Canadian model. has been consistent with a stronger Eastern trough since the middle of last. week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic air next week into the Eastern. U.S. The potential of some sort of East coast storm also remains in this. pattern. I am not by any means forecasting any brutal cold, but I am going. against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlooks which are above normal in. the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region will grade out slightly below. normal instead while the West is in a moderating phase.. For the period Tuesday February 5 through Saturday February 9, expect the. following temperature trends:. Average 4 to 6-degrees below normal: Intermountain West, Gulf Coast,. Southeast.... Average 1 to 3-degrees below normal: Desert SW, California, Northeast,. Mississippi Valley.... Average 1 to 3- degrees above normal: Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,. Mid-Atlantic, Rockies, Southern Plains... Average 4 to 6-degrees above normal: Northern and Central Plains.... Andy Weingarten, Meteorologist APB Energy / True Quote"

Corporate greed isn't to blame for energy crisis in California. JERRY TAYLOR, PETER VANDOREN. 04/01/2001. Houston Chronicle. 4 STAR. 4. (Copyright 2001). TO hear California's politicians tell it, heartless power- generating firms. are the cause of the high price of West Coast electricity.. Deregulation, the populists claim, allowed them to sell electricity at. astronomical prices in an utterly dysfunctional wholesale market. The Federal. Energy Regulatory Commission has now joined the witch hunt, ordering power. generators to refund the state of California $124 million for ""overcharges"". during the power emergencies in January and February. The only problem with. price controls, we're told, is that they're not more aggressively applied.. Have we learned nothing from economic history?. The commission maintains that it cost 27 cents on average to produce a. kilowatt hour of electricity during peak demand periods last January.. California regulators, however, report that they paid an average of 28 cents. for that power on the daily spot market. During February, wholesale natural. gas prices exploded, resulting in production costs of 43 cents per kilowatt. hour. Unfortunately, no published data exist to discern what that power. actually sold for. But given the size of the commission-ordered rebates and. the extent of the markups observed in previous months, it's unlikely that. wholesale prices were more than a few cents higher on average than production. costs. Nonetheless, because the commission's mission is to prohibit ""unjust. and unreasonable"" wholesale prices, the commission wants the generators to. give back the difference charged during the power emergencies earlier this. year.. The economic populists have seized on those commission orders as proof that. they're being robbed blind. But hold on a minute: The commission's data. clearly show that high wholesale electricity prices (which hovered around 3. cents per kilowatt hour before the crisis hit last year) are primarily the. result of higher production costs, not corporate greed. To be sure, industry. analysts believe that actual production costs during power emergencies are. far higher than the commission believes, but at least the commission has. recognized that input prices explain most of the spike. The upshot is that. higher production costs would have sent wholesale electricity prices through. the roof even if the Legislature had not ""deregulated"" its electricity market. in 1996.. The commission also implicitly concedes - rightly - that the highest cost. source of supply needed to meet demand is the legitimate price for all power. sold in the state. For instance, the cost of producing a kilowatt hour of. nuclear, coal, or renewable-fired electricity ranges from 2 cents to 6 cents,. but the commission does not propose to require those generators to price at. cost.. Given the overall shortage of electricity in the Western region, the. commission grants those power generators the right to charge what the market. will bear.. But wait: Why is it OK with the commission if some generators charge what the. market will bear, but not OK for other generators to do likewise? Top. electricity economists spanning the ideological spectrum agree that power. supplies are so tight in the West that most natural gas-fired generators can. charge more than their costs and still find willing buyers. Not only is this. not a crime were it to occur in any other market, it's necessary if. electricity is to be allocated to those who need it the most.. For the sake of argument, let's assume that about a nickel out of each. kilowatt hour sold during the peak demand periods in January represents. ""profiteering."" If so, don't blame the free market . . . it doesn't exist. In. California, generators can charge whatever they want during a crisis without. fear that the prices they name will reduce sales because the state insists. upon maintaining retail price controls. This is called a ""dream scenario."". Without those rate caps, generators would find that high prices reduce sales,. providing a disincentive against charging the moon. The upshot is that retail. price controls are themselves primarily responsible for whatever mischief. exists.. Still, we're arguing about a nickel out of a bill of 28-45 cents per kilowatt. hour. That's a lot of to-do about relatively nothing. Drum all those alleged. excess profits out of the market and we're still in a world in which. California ratepayers are getting one heck of a free ride. Even with the 40. percent rate hike passed last week, California ratepayers are still paying. only one-third to one-fifth the cost of the power they are consuming.. You don't need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that subsidies like that. will inevitably result in excessive consumption, scarcity and blackouts.. Those who think that denying the laws of supply and demand are the best way. out of this mess will soon be pondering such thoughts in the dark.. Drawing: (p. 1). Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.. . -. Report: Potential rate hike included in California power talks. LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The state's negotiations to buy power lines from ailing. Southern California Edison included a draft proposal that could mean another. rate hike for customers, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.. The newspaper said it obtained a 40-page draft memorandum of understanding,. dated last week, that among other things could obligate Edison customers to. help pay the utility's massive debt through a ""dedicated rate component"" --. potentially a rate hike -- even if no power line deal is reached.. The component, which wasn't specified, wouldn't show up in bills for two. years, according to the draft.. The document was dated Tuesday -- the same day that the state Public. Utilities Commission approved record rate increases of up to 42 percent for. Edison and 46 percent for PG&E.. The PUC was scheduled to meet Monday to determine how best to hear from as. many different groups as possible before implementing the increase.. A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said Sunday that the draft memorandum -- one. of several floated in the state's ongoing, nearly two-month-old talks with. Edison -- already is obsolete.. ""This draft is ancient history,"" Steve Maviglio said. ""We have moved beyond. that, and continue to make progress and hope to be able to make an. announcement shortly."" He did not provide other details.. On Friday, Edison officials described as ""very active"" talks with the. governor's office over the sale of its transmission lines to give the. struggling utility a cash infusion. But SCE chief financial officer Ted. Craver said a deal was not imminent.. In addition to Edison, Davis wants to buy electrical lines from Pacific Gas &. Electric Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for a combined total of about. $7 billion.. Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high. wholesale prices.. Talks between the state and PG&E are awaiting the outcome of the Edison deal,. PG&E spokesman John Nelson said Sunday.. Meanwhile, the Bush administration on Sunday reiterated its opposition to. price controls as a method of halting soaring energy costs, including. California's.. ""Our view is that price caps on energy create shortages. They created the gas. lines of the 1970s,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said on ABC's. ""This Week."". ""If we did them in California, for instance, where this call has gone out,. we'd have more blackouts this summer, they'd last longer, and they'd go on. into the future,"" Abraham said.. As for helping the state, ""we're doing the most that we can,"" Abraham said.. ""But as I've said, we don't have a generator in the basement of the. Department of Energy where I can automatically send electricity, whether it's. to California or another part of the country."". . -. Davis softens on rate hikes; Democrats fear backlash. By John Marelius?. UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER. April 1, 2001. ANAHEIM -- Gov. Gray Davis all but abandoned his once-adamant opposition to. electricity rate increases yesterday as angst over the potential political. fallout from the energy crisis dominated what had been planned as a weekend. of celebrating Democratic electoral gains in California.. In a speech to the California Democratic Party Convention, the governor. sketched the outlines of an alternative he is expected to propose to the rate. increases of up to 46 percent approved last week by the state Public. Utilities Commission.. ""If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and. keep our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor:. I'll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who conserve the. most and motivate those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut back,"" Davis. said.. Some question value of transmission lines. ?. Meanwhile, state Controller Kathleen Connell pointedly decried a ""delaying. and incremental"" approach to the energy crisis and warned of a voter backlash. against Democrats in next year's elections.. ""Just ask President Jimmy Carter what happens when you stall and you don't. solve the gas-line problem,"" Connell said. ""We don't want to have that happen. to California Democrats."". Davis, who has a history of animosity with Connell, shrugged off the unstated. but obvious critique of his handling of the crisis.. ""Everyone's entitled to their point of view, but I believe that we've moved. at warp speed to address this problem,"" he said. ""I'm pleased that we've been. able to keep the lights on most days. .?.?. Maybe if she's not happy with. that, she can run for governor next time."". One analyst speculated that may be exactly what Connell has in mind. She is. running for mayor of Los Angeles but is not expected to be a major factor,. and term limits prevent her from seeking a third term as controller next. year.. ""It's the opening salvo in the 2002 Democratic primary campaign,"" said Sherry. Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern. California. ""I don't know how else to interpret it."". With the election of President Bush and Republicans in control of Congress,. the Democratic Party finds itself in its weakest position nationally since. the Eisenhower administration. Yet in California, Democrats are in their. strongest position in decades as they hold all but one statewide office and. wide majorities in the state congressional delegation and both houses of the. Legislature.. A succession of convention speakers -- U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, House. Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Democratic National Committee. Chairman Terry McAuliffe -- excoriated Bush's assault on Democratic. environmental and worker safety regulations and held up the California. Democratic Party as a national model for Democratic electoral success.. ""If every Democratic Party in the country did what California did for House. Democrats, I would have the (House speaker's) gavel today,"" Gephardt said.. For the first time, Democrats are holding their state convention in Orange. County, a Republican stronghold where Democrats have been making solid. inroads because of the steady influx of immigrants from Asia and Latin. America.. ""This ain't your grandfather's Orange County,"" Davis crowed. ""You know,. Orange County has a Republican past, but it has a Democratic future."". Such self-congratulation was tempered by the awareness that because Democrats. hold such a position of dominance in California, voters will expect them to. solve the electricity problem even as Democrats continue to blame it on the. deregulation policies of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson.. ""There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state because we dominate. state government,"" Connell said.. She warned that continued ""finger-pointing"" would not solve the problem.. Other speakers continued to hammer away at Wilson as some of the walls in the. Anaheim Convention Center bore posters reading, ""Wilson did it."" And then. there was the message inside the fortune cookies: ""Energy fiasco. DNA proves. Wilson at crime scene."". ""What the voters have to understand is that we inherited this crisis,"" said. California Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres, who was elected to a second. four-year term yesterday. ""Now we've got to deal with it, and we should be. held accountable on how we deal with it."". Davis remains a strong favorite to win re-election next year, but his. once-robust popularity apparently has taken a major hit in recent weeks,. especially when blackouts began rolling across the state.. ""There are people polling and they show enormous deterioration in Davis'. numbers, and it looks like he's got some real political problems,"" said. Democratic strategist Bill Carrick. ""But ultimately, he's going to be judged. on how he manages the crisis and can he get a solution on this before next. year that makes some sense to people."". For months Davis said electricity rate increases were out of the question and. recently claimed he could have solved the problem in 20 minutes if he had. been willing to entertain them.. When the PUC voted its increase for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern. California Edison Co. on Tuesday, Davis called the action premature, but did. not offer an alternative. Yesterday, he said he was consulting with financial. analysts and would propose a rate plan before the end of the 30-day period. before the action of the independent commission becomes final.. ""I will have a fuller statement within the next two weeks, at which time I. will speak to what if any rate hike I think is appropriate and how tiered. pricing should be implemented,"" the governor said.. Davis lashed back at Republican legislators who have escalated their. criticism of his handling of the crisis. He blamed the GOP for the ill-fated. 1996 deregulation without mentioning that the plan cleared the Legislature. with unanimous Democratic support.. ""The Republicans who were so enamored with deregulation just five years ago. have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean up their. mess,"" Davis said. ""May I remind our Republican friends that this. deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator, passed by a. Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and implemented. with undue haste by a Republican PUC."". . -. Some question value of transmission lines. By Jeff McDonald?. UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER. April 1, 2001. Transmission lines have been upgraded. Poles are taller and sturdier.. Electricity is shuttled farther and faster than ever before.. But like internal combustion engines or indoor plumbing, not much has changed. over the past 100 years in the fundamental design of the distribution network. that pushes power across North America.. The electric grid, a vast collection of wires and switches, has served. millions of homes and businesses since the late 19th century. The grid has. been expanded again and again, decade after decade.. Now, with Gov. Gray Davis negotiating to buy huge sections of the grid owned. by three cash-hungry California utilities, questions are being raised about. the long-term value of such a dated delivery system.. Is the web of power lines a key link in the supply chain whose worth will. climb higher and higher as demand for electricity grows? Or will looming. technology render the grid obsolete even before the state can pay off the. bonds it issues to buy the system?. ""The usefulness of the grid is still intact -- it does work,"" said Mark. McLaughlin, a researcher with the Alternative Energy Institute, a Tahoe. City-based group that promotes renewable power sources.. But ""it will become less important over time -- 10, 15 years,"" he said. ""As. for being completely reliant on it, that is changing now and will continue to. change at an ever-increasing pace."". Technological advances already are redefining traditional electricity. delivery.. With blackouts crippling businesses across the state -- and additional. outages forecast for this summer -- more and more companies are investing in. so-called distributed generation, a broad term applied to any number of. devices that can make power on-site.. Increasingly popular products such as microturbines, cogeneration plants,. photovoltaic systems and residential fuel cells allow consumers to limit. their reliance on utility companies such as San Diego Gas and Electric.. ""This (power) crisis has generated a huge amount of interest in the product,"". said Mark Kuntz of Capstone, a San Fernando Valley-based company that markets. 30-and 60-kilowatt microturbines.. ""We're in the process of responding to that interest and turning it into. orders."". The abundance of alternatives for businesses and homeowners has propelled a. new debate: what to do with the surplus power produced by distributed. generation systems.. Investors are banking that the electric grid will remain hugely valuable. because it can move energy in any direction.. ""We are building a company around our bullishness on the grid,"" said Fred. Buckman, chairman of Trans-Elect Inc., a private Washington, D.C.-based. company that plans to spend $15 billion acquiring transmission lines.. ""The deployment of smaller distributed generation systems will reduce the. rate at which we have to grow the transmission system, but we don't believe. it will replace the grid."". Trans-Elect bid up to $5 billion for the lines owned by Southern California. Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric, and SDG&E. But that offer was pushed aside. by utility company executives when it became clear that Davis wanted the grid. for the state of California.. More important to utilities, however, may be the eventual sales price.. Edison agreed in principle to sell its share of transmission lines to the. state for $2.76 billion. But details of that proposed deal -- announced in. February -- remain to be worked out.. In the meantime, lawmakers are growing anxious about continuing delays. Some. legislators say Davis should rethink buying the grid and instead consider. acquiring the utilities' hydroelectric networks.. The $2.76 billion price tag for the Edison lines is about 2.3 times the their. book value -- the base worth used by regulators to set rates of return.. If PG&E and SDG&E reach similar deals with the governor, the cost of. acquiring some 32,000 miles of transmission lines could reach $7.4 billion --. too much, some consumer advocates worry, to make the transaction a good deal. for ratepayers.. Public ownership of the grid would give the state a powerful hand in dealing. with federal energy regulators, who so far have refused to rein in power. generators, consumer groups say.. The acquisition also would curtail unnecessary additions to the system,. investments that provide guaranteed profits to the current owners, activists. say.. ""The state isn't looking to make money expanding the system,"" said Michael. Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network. ""The state can establish a. policy that says no new grid will be built where distributed generation can. substitute."". But many experts believe that even as microturbines, fuel cells, windmills,. solar power and more cogeneration plants take root in coming years, the grid. will be needed to deliver surplus power to other places that can use it.. Without having ways to move power from place to place, a major benefit of. distributed generation would fall by the wayside.. ""The only way small assets are useful is if they can be shared when some. power isn't needed, and you can't do that without a grid,"" said Mark P.. Mills, an energy consultant and co-editor of the Digital Power Report.. ""The grid becomes more important the more you distribute things."". Nancy Floyd is a co-founder of Nth Power, a San Francisco venture capital. group that seeks investment opportunities in utility innovations --. particularly the transmission and distribution of electricity.. Five years ago, the firm had $50 million to spend. By 1999, the investment. pool had climbed to $350 million. Last year, the company portfolio soared to. $1 billion.. ""This is an area that's attracting a lot of capital, which means you're going. to have a steady stream of new products and services,"" Floyd said. ""That is. the bright side of deregulation."". Pure Energy Corp. of Syracuse, N.Y., has operated the Iceoplex cogeneration. plant in Escondido since 1994. It sells its 50 or so megawatts to SDG&E,. which transmits the power over the grid for use by its customers.. The firm has been floating plans to double capacity at the plant just east of. Interstate 15, but company executive Jack Wolf said a ruling by California. regulators last week has him rethinking expansion plans.. Adding new turbines or cogeneration plants can rub neighbors the wrong way.. Smokestacks billow out steam, which some residents say is unsightly even if. the plume of white is only harmless water vapors.. Wolf said his company met several times with Escondido residents to iron out. concerns about boosting capacity at the Iceoplex.. ""If you're doing something like (expanding), you've got to meet with the. communities, understand what their concerns are and work with them,"" Wolf. said.. Taxpayer advocates, meanwhile, do not worry whether the grid will remain. viable over the next decade or two. Instead, they fear the government. takeover of an aging network of poles and wires.. ""You're going to be socializing a massive infrastructure,"" said Jonathan. Coupal, director of legal affairs for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers. Association.. ""The state of California can't even maintain the damn roads,"" he said. ""Now. we're going to be taking on not only the purchase but the ongoing maintenance. of a huge infrastructure?"". At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., researchers. work to improve the efficiency of alternative energy programs and promote. their use among mainstream consumers.. But even as workplaces and neighborhoods across the country move toward. supplying their own power, the transmission system will remain a vital part. of the network that delivers electricity from place to place, experts say.. ""Will the grid be obsolete in 20 years? Absolutely not. Things don't move. that fast,"" said George Douglas of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.. ""But we need to be forward-looking.. ""If each office park and subdivision has its own power source, that doesn't. mean you don't want them linked, because things do fail."". Stanford S. Penner, director of the UCSD Center for Energy Research, is. convinced that the power grid will remain critical for decades to come.. History has shown that implementing new technology takes far longer than. inventing it, he said.. ""The turnover by a new technology has usually taken 40 to 50 years,"" he said.. ""Twenty years from now, they will still be relying on the transmission lines.. Forty years from now, they may be starting to phase them out."". . --. This Summer, Power-Hungry U.S. May Feel West's Pain. By ERIC SLATER, Times Staff Writer. ?????CHICAGO--California's electricity meltdown has been so spectacular that,. until recently, much of the rest of the country was sitting back, feet up,. watching the rolling-blackout show on television.. ?????No longer. As summer approaches, utility operators across the nation are. scrambling to shore up their own systems, many of which are themselves in the. murky middle of deregulation and in varying states of neglect and disrepair.. ?????In Chicago, the recently overwhelmed power provider actually advises. competitors on where to build power plants. In New York City, officials say. the difference between light and dark this summer may be 11 mini-generators.. And in states from Arkansas to North Carolina, legislators are watching. California's deregulation fiasco and slamming the brakes on their own plans.. ?????The West is bound to suffer the most this summer, experts agree, but. it's going to feel long and hot across much of the rest of the country,. whether it really is or not. And with the economy already sputtering, the. largest power shortage since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 could be nudging. the country toward recession.. ?????""Pray for continuous clouds,"" advised San Francisco-based energy. consultant Edward Kahn.. ?????A good word for cheaper gasoline in the Midwest, strong backs for coal. miners in the South and lower natural gas prices from coast to coast might be. in order as well.. ?????In the U.S., electricity flows a bit like water in that the two largest. grids separate roughly along the Continental Divide. Power generated in the. West stays there, for the most part, and likewise the juice in the East.. (Texas has its own grid.). ?????With California, the world's sixth-largest economy, continuing to. founder after its steady diet of deregulation mistakes, the other 10 mostly. rural states in the Western grid are likely to suffer as well. As Rep. Jay. Inslee (D-Wash.) put it: ""You can, today, see blackouts coming, big as life,. and an energy crisis going into the fall."". ?????The Eastern Interconnect, however, is larger than its Western sibling,. more diverse in its sources and more complex in its physical structure, and. thereby protected from some Western-style utility woes. But, from a serious. transmission-line bottleneck near Eau Claire, Wis., to a 28-year-old Florida. law that some say is stifling much-needed growth, the Eastern grid has its. own kinks, soft spots and weaknesses.. ?????If things start getting out of hand on this side of the Rockies, the. first fissure is likely to appear in the last place a fissure is needed: New. York.. ?????When rates for many California customers shot up by as much as 46% last. week, New Yorkers could commiserate. They have seen their rates rise 40%. since 1999. A sweltering July or August could send prices up an additional. 50%, some analysts predict. As in California, New York has deregulated its. power industry, so the market, not the state, sets the price. And as in. California, New York is heavily dependent on natural gas to fire its. generators--a commodity whose price has skyrocketed recently.. ?????New York, again like California, also fell behind in the construction of. new plants--the last one going up in 1995--even as demand was growing. dramatically.. ?????Now the city's power provider, Consolidated Edison, figures it has a. thin insulation of extra kilowatts to get it through the summer--unless it's. a bad one. Just in case, Con Ed wants to sprinkle the 11 mini-generators. throughout the city. Environmentalists, concerned about the air pollutants. the generators will kick out, have already filed suit to stop the plan.. ?????Upstate New York has electricity surpluses ready to sell to the Big. Apple. So does the nearby PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland). Interconnection, which serves more than 22 million customers along the. Eastern Seaboard and has deregulated cautiously and effectively.. ?????But ""New York City--even assuming those generators come on line--is. going to be nip-and-tuck,"" said Bill Brier, vice president of Edison Electric. Institute, which represents private utilities.. ?????The reason: Transmission bottlenecks make it all but impossible for the. city to import power on especially bad days. The Eastern grid is a much more. intricate web than that in the West, a mesh of more and smaller lines. ferrying electricity to a more evenly distributed population. But. deregulation has fundamentally changed how the grid is used without preparing. it for its new free-market role.. ?????Constructed as a heavily regulated series of channels for efficiently. floating power from one utility with extra power to another in need, the grid. is now open to private electricity merchants who sell to the highest bidder.. In 1996, 25,000 transactions took place on the grid, according to the Edison. institute. By 1999, that figure had rocketed to 2 million.. ?????""That,"" said Brier, ""is why you're having more and more bottlenecks in. the system."". ?????While deregulation has forced utilities to open up their transmission. lines to competitors, it has also allowed the marketplace--rather than. need--to dictate where new lines are strung.. ?????In Minnesota, state officials would like new lines to come in from the. west and north, bringing cheap power from the Dakotas and Canada. But. Minnesota utilities would rather build lines in the opposite direction,. enabling them to sell power to Chicago and Milwaukee for perhaps twice the. price they're getting from Minnesota customers.. ?????Of course, the utilities are running into the problem that always. accompanies proposed construction of 13-story metal towers buzzing with. megawatts: massive public opposition. In Wisconsin, a powerful grass-roots. group called Save Our Unique Lands calls one proposed line a ""250-mile scar"". and points out that the line would go primarily to benefit not Wisconsinites. but their oft-derided urban neighbors, Chicagoans.. ?????Just two years ago, Chicago, not California, was the daytime nightmare. of the electrical world. A summer of blackouts large and small began in July,. when more than 100,000 customers lost power on a 104-degree day, and. continued on and off for weeks, with 30 blocks of the central business. district going black for hours one Thursday afternoon.. ?????Mayor Richard M. Daley went ballistic when Commonwealth Edison revealed. it couldn't warn of rolling blackouts because it wasn't sure how its. byzantine cable system works. After hundreds of millions of dollars in. upgrades, Chicago will still be vulnerable to blackouts this summer. But the. outages will be isolated problems of overload or mechanical breakdown, not. the systemic failures likely in the West.. ?????In Illinois, restructuring that began in 1997 has gone relatively. smoothly, and the state and much of the Midwest has benefited from solid. policy and a decent amount of luck.. ?????Just over half of Illinois' power comes from coal-fired plants, which. are cranking it out at a fraction of the cost of natural gas-driven. generators. An additional 42% comes from Illinois' 11 nuclear power. plants--more than any other state.. ?????Only recently the ultimate utility albatross, nuclear reactors are. gaining some favor in the Bush administration. Operated by ComEd, which is. still working hard to burnish its image after the 1999 blackouts, every. reactor in Illinois is not only up and running but at record output,. according to David Helwig, ComEd vice president for operations.. ?????In a brilliant public relations move, ComEd also printed maps of the. best sites for new generators and handed them out to competitors. With less. stringent environmental laws than in California, which hasn't built a major. plant in a decade, Illinois has continued to build.. ?????More than 3,000 megawatts went online last year--about 10% of the. state's total load--and 10,000 more are planned for this year. ""If we have a. problem in the Midwest, it's not going to be with generation, it's going to. be with the transmission grid,"" said Terry Harvill of the Illinois Commerce. Commission.. ?????When the Eau Claire-Arpin line in Wisconsin overloaded at the same time. as a transformer in southeastern Ohio in June 1998, the Midwest became all. but isolated from the rest of the Eastern grid. And the incident demonstrated. dramatically another problem of deregulation that could still haunt the. system this summer. As operators scrambled to stave off blackouts, prices on. the spot market skyrocketed from $25 per megawatt hour to $7,500 per megawatt. hour.. ?????Tom Overbye, an electrical and computer engineer at the University of. Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, wrote about the incident in a paper on. deregulation's effect on the power grid. ""Imagine your consternation,"" he. wrote in American Scientist, ""if one day you pulled into a gas station and. discovered the price had increased three-hundredfold, from $1.50 per gallon. to $450 per gallon."". ?????The South, with its massive coal reserves, slow population growth and,. for the most part, a go-slow approach to deregulation, is likely to weather. its typical summer swelter, with one possible exception: Florida.. ?????With a fast-growing population and a huge predicted shortfall of 11,000. megawatts over the next eight years, Florida had been a key target of. merchant operators looking to build. ""Everyone saw Florida as the place to. go,"" said Rick Rhodes of Duke Energy, a major private supplier.. ?????But when Duke prepared to build a 514-megawatt plant in New Smyrna, the. state's three investor-owned utilities filed suit under a nearly 3-decade-old. law restricting the entry of power wholesalers into the state. The Florida. Supreme Court ruled for the utilities, and Duke and other merchants planning. to build certain types of plants have, for the time, shelved their plans.. ?????When it comes to transmission, Florida has another problem. Out-of-state. power can come from but one direction: north.. ?????Supporters of deregulation are swift to point out that tinkering with a. $218-billion industry is bound to be painful at first and that while. California's debacle will take years to solve, other states will learn from. its experience.. ?????As spring settles in, the Great Lakes thaw and half a dozen legislatures. begin tinkering anew with deregulation plans, a less optimistic school of. thought appears to be developing. ""The California situation is so bad that it. confuses people,"" said Harvard University energy economist William H. Hogan.. ""It scares people. It paralyzes people. . . . They learn the wrong lessons. and do the wrong things to fix it."". Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times. . -. State, Edison Discussed Pact to Pay Off Firm's Huge Debt. Proposed deal would commit customers to aiding utility even if that meant. another rate hike. Davis spokesman says memo has been changed significantly.. By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer. ?????SACRAMENTO--A draft agreement between the Davis administration and. Southern California Edison would seek to return the utility to financial. stability by committing ratepayers to help pay off its multibillion-dollar. debt in future years even if the state's proposed purchase of Edison's. transmission system falls through. ?????The proposal, which could translate. into yet another electricity rate hike on top of the record increase approved. last week, contains provisions that would assure investors and creditors of. Edison's ability to dodge bankruptcy. Yet those elements appear certain, if. they remain in the final version, to anger some consumer advocates and. lawmakers.. ?????As negotiations continue between Edison and the administration, a. spokesman for the governor cautioned that the draft, dated last Tuesday and. obtained by The Times, has been updated and changed significantly.. ?????Nevertheless, the 40-page memorandum of understanding lays out the most. detailed framework yet of the administration's attempt to avert the utility's. bankruptcy. Gov. Gray Davis has made a state rescue of debt-ridden Edison and. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. a key part of efforts to tame California's energy. crisis. Negotiations with PG&E have lagged, but officials believe a deal with. Edison could set the stage for similar agreements with the other utilities.. ?????""This draft is ancient history,"" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Sunday of the document dated six days ago. ""We have moved beyond that, and. continue to make progress and hope to be able to make an announcement. shortly."". ?????Executives of Rosemead-based Edison could not be reached for comment.. ?????There is at least one more recent draft, officials said. But the. document from Tuesday reflects the direction of negotiations. Internal memos. dating back weeks describe similar elements in the discussions.. ?????The talks have been going on behind closed doors for almost two months.. Even legislative leaders, including Davis' fellow Democrats, have learned. little about details of the talks--to their dismay.. ?????""I have no idea what's in the memorandum of understanding,"" Senate. President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said Sunday. ""But the. Legislature is going to hold very comprehensive public hearings, so we know. what we're getting into. . . . Whatever the deals are, we're going to have. very full and open hearings: What is it we're getting? What is it we're. giving? And what is the price?"". ?????The draft shows, as previously announced, that Davis is offering to buy. Edison's portion of the 32,000-mile-long statewide system of high-voltage. transmission lines for $2.76 billion, or 2.3 times its listed book value. For. the transaction to work, Davis hopes as well to buy the portions of the grid. owned by PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric Co., for a total price of about $7. billion.. ?????The document says the state would buy the transmission grid ""as is,. where is, and with all faults"" and would contract with Edison to operate its. portion at a price to be negotiated. If the state decides to sell the grid at. some later date, Edison, like other businesses, would have the right to bid. to buy it back.. ?????Edison would use cash from the purchase to help pay off its massive. debt--the gap between skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices and what the. utility was allowed to charge ratepayers. In federal filings, Edison has. estimated that debt at $5.5 billion; barring regulatory or legislative. relief, the utility's parent company said in its most recent filing, it may. take a $2.7-billion charge against earnings for the fourth quarter of 2000.. ?????But the state takeover could fail for a variety of reasons; the Federal. Energy Regulatory Commission could, for example, block the state effort.. ?????The document gives no specifics about a backup plan for the state to. acquire other assets if it fails in its efforts to take over the entire. transmission system. However, the draft does contain provisions that would. allow Edison to again become financially viable.. ?????In particular, the draft agreement says consumers could be obligated to. pay a so-called dedicated rate component to help the utility restructure its. debt, even if the grid sale is not completed. The memorandum further states. that the charge would not appear in rates for two years, and that the debt. would be repaid over 12 years.. ?????The charge, at an amount not specified in the draft agreement,. presumably would be on top of electricity rate hikes approved last week that. could be as high as 46% for some users. As such, the charge would face. certain opposition from Republican lawmakers, who have criticized the rate. hikes, and from some Democratic legislators, who are increasingly skeptical. about Davis' handling of the crisis.. ?????Consumer advocate Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network explained. the provision by saying it may simply authorize Edison to begin restructuring. its debt, pending final approval of the highly complex transmission grid. sale, which could take a year or more to consummate.. ?????""This is a huge transaction,"" Florio said. ""They can't wait until the. deal is signed, sealed and delivered."". ?????But V. John White, of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable. Technology, among the first lobbyists to float the idea of a state takeover. of the utilities' transmission systems, said some terms outlined in the. tentative agreement are causing him to rethink his position.. ?????""I don't see where the public benefits are,"" White said of the overall. deal. ""The price of the transmission sale is a complete capitulation to. Edison."". ?????The tentative agreement contemplates that the California Public. Utilities Commission, which has the responsibility to regulate the state's. investor-owned utilities, would lose the ability to make at least some. decisions.. ?????The agreement says, for example, that Edison's credit-worthiness and. ability to finance improvements to its remaining holdings would require. ""greater certainty in respect of [Edison's] ability to earn a fair return on. invested capital."". ?????Toward that end, the tentative agreement would limit the PUC's ability. to pare back the utility's current 11.6% authorized rate of return on. investment, the document says.. ?????""Nothing like this has ever been done anywhere in the country,"" White. said. ""This would be a regulatory jailbreak."". ?????Among other provisions, the memorandum says Edison would drop its. lawsuit against the PUC seeking the right to pass on its wholesale. electricity costs to consumers.. ?????The draft is dated the same day that the PUC approved a rate hike of. about 40% to cover the state's costs of buying electricity from independent. power producers. The state started buying electricity, at an average daily. cost of more than $50 million, after Edison and PG&E fell so deeply into debt. that they no longer were credit-worthy.. ?????Executives at PG&E, the state's largest electric utility, have agreed to. consider parting with its portion of the transmission grid. But details. remain to be decided. PG&E spokesman John Nelson said Sunday that talks. between Davis and his company await the outcome of the Edison deal.. ?????""It's not because there is any breakdown,"" Nelson said. ""It is just that. they've concentrated their efforts on Edison."". Copyright 2001 Los Angeles Times. . . Vegas Lights Undimmed. Despite soaring prices for electricity, the big hotel-casinos don't plan to. reduce their dazzling wattage outside. But they are cutting energy use. indoors.. By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer. ?????LAS VEGAS--The newspaper stories about California's electricity woes can. be read easily at night on the Strip, bathed in the brilliance of miles of. neon and a gazillion lightbulbs.. ?????And Nevada utility officials expect it to stay that way through the. summer--when air conditioners work day and night to make the desert heat. tolerable--avoiding the power problems that have brought California to its. knees.. ?????But that confidence is coming at a price: increased electricity rates,. to the consternation of the Strip's monster hotel-casinos. Between September. and April, rates will have increased by about 46%, driven by forces that are. pushing up energy costs nationwide.. ?????The typical Strip hotel-casino uses about the same amount of electricity. as 10,000 homes, according to utility estimates. Like anxious homeowners,. hotel-casino operators are scouring their properties, looking for ways to. conserve electricity and--more important perhaps to Wall Street--save money.. ?????At the MGM Grand, maintenance crews are working their way through the. 5,005 rooms, changing lightbulbs to dimmer ones, reducing each room's. consumption to 500 watts from 750.. ?????At the MGM and other hotels, incandescent bulbs are being changed for. more efficient fluorescent lights in many cases. Thermostats are being. installed to reduce air conditioning in unused convention rooms, and motion. sensors are being installed to keep the lights off in empty offices.. ?????Even slot machines are part of the trend: The newest models consume. about 160 watts of electricity, 25% less than older models, said a spokesman. for the world's largest slots maker, International Game Technology.. ?????But one thing won't change: blazing signs and extensive use of exterior. lighting to illuminate the resorts.. ?????""Las Vegas has an image and a certain cachet it has to live up to, and. that includes the exterior lighting and the neon and the marquees,"" said John. Marz, a vice president of Mandalay Resort Group, which owns four big Strip. casino-hotels and operates a fifth.. ?????""It's what people come here to see,"" he said. ""And reducing those would. be the last thing we do."". ?????Even as casinos look for places to cut corners, they're also fighting a. bigger battle in the state capital of Carson City to reverse the state Public. Utilities Commission's approval of a single, whopping 25% rate hike for. casinos, which took effect March 1. At the same time, residential rates. increased by nearly 15%.. ?????The rate increases were sought by Nevada Power Co., which serves Las. Vegas and surrounding areas, and its sister utility in northern Nevada,. Sierra Pacific Power Co., to pay for electricity they already have contracted. to buy this summer. That one-time increase is in addition to rate hikes. approved earlier that are raising rates more than 1% a month, starting last. September and continuing until September 2003.. ?????By the end of that three-year period, residential electricity rates will. have increased about 75%, and the rates charged casinos will have increased. by about 65%, said utility spokesman Karl Walquist.. ?????The issue is simple, Nevada Power says: Customers must pay more for. electricity so the utility can remain solvent and buy power on the open. market. Otherwise, Walquist said, the state's two utilities will face the. same dire consequences that are playing out in California.. ?????Through its own four power plants, Nevada Power generates about 2,000. megawatts. It buys another 300 megawatts from small, private generators in. Nevada, and another 230 from the federal hydroelectric plant at Hoover Dam.. ?????Though the dam was built to create the Lake Mead reservoir, it was also. equipped to generate 2,000 megawatts of hydroelectric power, for sale to. agencies in California, Arizona and Nevada. However, it operates at only. about 30% capacity, based on the amount of water released through the. turbines for purchase by various California and Arizona agencies downstream.. ?????Come summer, southern Nevada will need about 4,600 megawatts, nearly. double its winter demand. To meet the 2,100-megawatt shortfall, Nevada Power. has contracted for electricity generated in Utah, Arizona and Colorado.. ?????The most jarring rate increase, yielding $311 million statewide in. higher revenue to pay for those advance purchases, was approved by the. state's PUC in February without public hearings.. ?????That decision triggered an angry response from the state attorney. general's consumer advocate, as well as from the gambling and mining. industries.. ?????They complained that the utilities had failed to publicly prove the need. for more money, and that the rate increase violated agreements between the. utilities and the PUC--with the casino industry's blessing--calling for the. small, measured rate increases every month.. ?????A PUC hearing officer on March 23 heard testimony from the utilities and. a consumer group on the need for rate increases, and a PUC decision is. pending.. ?????Nevada legislators and Gov. Kenny Guinn are immersed in the electricity. issue. The state began moving toward deregulation four years ago, but. reversed itself after watching California's problems unfold. Deregulation is. no longer on the state's radar screen.. ?????Legislators also are attempting to block plans by the state's utilities. to sell their power plants so they can focus on transmission and. distribution. The lawmakers fear that if the utilities lose control of power. generators, Nevada will be even more at the mercy of private power companies.. ?????In the meantime, the Strip's lights continue to shine brightly, and. utility officials say skeptics should not look too critically at them as. power hogs.. ?????""They're very efficient, especially in terms of cooling as many people. as they do,"" said Mike Smart, vice president of resource management for both.

Sacramento -- Billions of dollars in electricity purchases, rate increases. that will drain money from the economy and a crumbled stock market are. shriveling California's state budget.. Even the modest estimates of revenue growth on which Gov. Gray Davis' budget. was based are being erased by the power crisis and the stock slide.. ""The assumption we had in January is no longer a prudent assumption,"" said. Ted Gibson, chief economist at Davis' Department of Finance.. Although the flat economy is already pinching the state's cash intake, the. biggest hit will come at tax time 2002 -- 10 months into the budget Davis and. lawmakers are trying to put together before the new fiscal year starts on. July 1.. Next April there won't be the bonanza of capital gains and cashed-out stock. options the state has reveled in over the past two years.. Hard times in the dot-com world mean hard decisions for the Democratic. governor and lawmakers as they put together a spending plan.. On the Senate floor last week, President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San. Francisco, warned his colleagues not to expect too much from the budget. because the state was tapped out.. Everything from pork barrel projects to public schools could feel the pain.. A raft of one-time spending items are at risk: $250 million in aid to cities. and counties, $100 million to clean up beaches, $100 million to replace. higher-polluting diesel engines, $40 million in library improvements at state. universities.. The Senate has already cut $1.9 billion from the $102 billion spending plan. sent to them by Davis.. Davis' January budget expected the fiscal year to end with $5.8 billion in. reserve. Some $3.7 billion in electricity purchases have cut that reserve to. $2.1 billion with another $1 billion in energy buys authorized just for this. month.. That has led the legislative analyst to recommend that lawmakers take no. action on $2.3 billion in one-time spending proposed by the Democratic. governor.. ""We're being very cautious because of the number of uncertainties,"" said Brad. Williams, chief economist at the legislative analyst's office.. There are several reasons for the worsening cash drain, which will hit. hardest next year but is already taking a toll on revenue collections.. One-fifth of the state's general fund revenue comes from capital gains and. stock options.. That won't be happening next April.. In January, Davis predicted state taxes paid on capital gains and stock. option income would be 10 percent less next year. And projections now are. that it will be even less.. As more companies use stock options as compensation for employees, the more. tightly the state budget is chained to the whims of Wall Street.. Last year, the state estimated that $84 billion in stock option income was. generated in California. Of that, just seven high-tech companies created half. of the income. Cisco Systems alone represented nearly 10 percent of the $84. billion.. Since November, the Nasdaq has lost 45.5 percent of its value, a huge hit for. California, the center of the dot-com high-tech universe.. For example, Cisco has fallen from roughly $55 a share to $16 a share, making. it unlikely any holders of stock options will cash out unless they have to.. Similar drops have occurred in other big technology companies like Sun. Microsystems, Intel and Oracle.. ""The phase we saw the last several years will not return,"" said Tom Lieser. senior economist at UCLA's Anderson Business Forecast. ""The days of the dot-. com millionaires are over."". ""The technology sector will come back, but this year is going to be a tough. one, and next year may be transitional,"" Lieser said.. Income from investors realizing capital gains was originally expected to. reach nearly $94 billion this year and fall to $84.5 billion next year, but. budget analysts now say that next year's projections may be too optimistic.. If the stock market soars over the next eight months, the budget picture. could brighten.. Another budget plus could be the taxes collected this month. Stronger than. expected revenue would stanch some of next year's losses.. The economy's fade is already being felt. A slow holiday spending season last. year has led to less-than-expected sales tax collections for the state.. Sales tax revenue for February came in $165 million under estimates.. And withholding taxes, which are carved out of an employee's paycheck and. sent to the state, are expected to continue to grow, but not nearly at the. brisk rate as last year.. Then there's the energy crisis.. The state is tearing through $50 million a day to buy power for the cash-. poor utilities, with authorization for $4.7 billion in purchases.. ""Even Bill Gates would feel that after a while,"" said Lieser.. So far, the agencies that decide California's credit rating aren't worried. because Davis and lawmakers plan to make the state whole by issuing bonds in. May or June.. That was one reason for the Public Utilities Commission's average 40 percent. electricity rate increase: to create a big enough revenue stream to make. investors more comfortable about buying the bonds.. The rate increase is going to take $4.8 billion from businesses and. consumers, money that might otherwise be spent in other parts of the economy.. Although total income in California last year was nearly $1.2 trillion, $4. 8. billion is still a chunk of change.. ""It will be a factor depressing growth somewhat over the next year,"" said. Williams.. The economic effect of the energy mess is longer-term. How much will. blackouts hurt productivity? Will businesses expand in California or. somewhere else with a more reliable supply of energy?. Gibson says businesses are going to give the state 18 months to sort out its. energy problems which Gibson thinks the state will do.. ""The silver lining is that the 2-by-4 has been applied to the donkey's head,. "" Gibson said. ""We've learned we have a problem with energy supply, and three. or four years down the road this will settle out, and we may even have a. surplus."". Grumbles Lieser: ""The thing about this is it should have been foreseen.. People were warning us."". E-mail Greg Lucas at glucas@sfchronicle.com.. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 1. . -. Davis Blames Crisis On State Republicans. But Democratic controller points at governor. Carla Marinucci, John Wildermuth, Chronicle Political Writers. Sunday, April 1, 2001. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle. URL:. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/01/M. N154353.DTL. Anaheim -- The politics of energy dominated the state Democratic convention. yesterday, as anxious delegates gave a lukewarm reception to embattled Gov.. Gray Davis, who clashed bitterly with party rival, Controller Kathleen. Connell.. Speaking at the Anaheim convention center, where dimmed lights were a. constant reminder of yesterday's Stage 2 alert, Davis blamed California's. energy woes on former Gov. Pete Wilson, Republican lawmakers and the Federal. Energy Regulatory Commission, which, he charged, has failed to regulate. greedy energy firms selling power at ""out of control prices."". He insisted that he was not sure rate increases were necessary, refusing to. say whether he would support huge hikes backed by the Public Utilities. Commission last week. He suggested, however, that he favors a system of. tiered electricity pricing.. ""These Republicans -- who were so enamored with deregulation just five years. ago -- have become even more enamored with criticizing me as I try to clean. up their mess,"" the governor said to tepid applause from the 1,900 delegates.. ""This deregulation disaster was authored by a Republican legislator,. passed by a Republican Assembly, signed into law by a Republican governor and. implemented with undue haste by a Republican PUC."". But the governor's Republican-bashing was overshadowed politically by an. attack by state Controller Connell, a candidate for Los Angeles mayor -- who. rejected what she called Davis' ""finger-pointing"" and assailed his handling. of the crisis. The dramatic development demonstrated both deepening rifts. within California's ruling party and the high political stakes of the energy. crisis.. ""There will be no excuses for Democrats in this state, because we dominate. state government,"" Connell said in a convention speech in which she also. outlined proposals to require ""power hogs,"" such as malls, to install their. own microgenerators.. ""I spent the past eight years making sure the state had a surplus, and now. I'm seeing it eaten away every day by energy costs. . . . Whatever solution. (the governor) provides must come fast and be shared openly with the people. of California,"" she said in a dig at Davis, who has been criticized for. moving too cautiously and for resisting disclosure of energy contracts to the. public.. Warning of the costs of ""a delay and an incremental approach to an indefinite. problem,"" she said, ""I won't stand by and allow the consumers to pick up the. tab."". DAVIS DEFENDS POLICIES. Asked to respond to Connell's critique, Davis told reporters, ""I believe. we've moved at warp speed to address this problem. . . . We've kept the light. on most days."". The governor, who endorsed Connell's opponent, former Assembly Speaker. Antonio Villaraigosa for mayor, then added, ""It might be if she's not happy. with that, she can run for governor next time."". Garry South, the governor's senior political adviser, was even more caustic,. lambasting Connell as a party infidel. ""This is why Kathleen Connell doesn't. have a friend in all Los Angeles,"" he said. ""She's been picking on the. governor since day one."". ""It's all air,"" he said of her talk. ""Not only hot air but a foul wind."". In an interview while campaigning later in the day, Connell toughened her. rhetoric, saying, ""The emperor has no more clothes here in California."". ""We are well into the fifth month (of the energy crisis) and we have yet to. find any answers from the administration,"" said Connell, who promised to. release her own detailed solutions to the crisis next week.. Unlike many Democrats at the convention, festooned with ""Wilson Did It"". signs, she rejected as ""irrelevant"" the suggestion by Davis that Republicans. were to blame for California's energy woes.. ""Californians are wearying of this finger-pointing and closed-door. negotiations and extended debate,"" she told The Chronicle. ""The public is no. longer going to be patient with us. They're going to hold the governor. accountable when they get the bill."". CONNELL LAGGING IN POLL. Connell, who is forced by term limits to give up her post as controller next. year, has lagged in her campaign to become mayor of Los Angeles. With 10 days. to the election, a recent poll showed her running fourth behind City Attorney. James Hahn, Villaraigosa and businessman Steve Soboroff.. Despite Davis' words and speculation among delegates, Connell denied she was. eyeing the governor's seat for the future. ""I'm not looking two or three. years down the line,"" she said. ""But I hope the governor is looking toward an. immediate solution to this problem."". The governor's speech was his first since the PUC announced rate increases of. as much as 46 percent. Davis refused to say whether he would support the. immediate rate increase approved by the PUC but suggested that he would back. a tiered billing system.. ""If a rate increase becomes absolutely necessary to keep our lights on and. our economy strong, you can be sure of one thing from this governor,"" Davis. said. ""I'll fight to protect those least able to pay, reward those who. conserve the most and 'motivate' those who are the biggest guzzlers to cut. back."". He later dodged reporters' questions about specifics, repeatedly saying that. within the next two weeks he would release a statement detailing ""what, if. any"" increases were needed.. ""Many advisers from Wall Street are running numbers, and they appear to be. different from the PUC's,"" he said.. Davis also said he has already done a lot to address the crisis and had ""kick. started"" construction of new power plants and successfully promoted. conservation programs.. Some of Davis' backers at the convention, watching the squabbling, expressed. concern about some of the governor's tactics.. ""People want a leader to lead,"" said Susan Leal, San Francisco's city. treasurer. ""They're looking for someone to come out and take command,. regardless of who started this."". But, she said, Davis is a tough and smart politician, and ""people are still. going to be forgiving if (the governor) does something to attack the. problem."". OTHER DEMOCRATS BLAME GOP. Other Democratic Party leaders were also quick to defend Davis and to blame. Republicans.. Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, suggested. that President Bush has ignored California's energy problems because ""he's. worried to death about Davis running for president."". California is the world's sixth-biggest economy, McAuliffe noted in an. interview, and Bush ""has basically written it off, saying, 'Good luck to you.. You're not getting any help.' "". Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party, said Davis ""is attacked. every day by the backbench Republican yahoos in the Legislature"" and. predicted that public concern over energy would ebb by next year's election.. ""We're looking at issues that are going to transcend the energy issues we see. now,"" Torres said, such as crime and violence in the schools, economics, the. environment and abortion.. But political analyst Sherry Bebich Jeffee said Connell's criticism was. evidence of a party split and perhaps ""the opening salvo in 2002,"" when Davis. is up for re-election.. Davis's entire party, she said, could be in trouble if voters get fed up with. higher energy bills.. ""Do the math,"" said Jeffee, noting that Democrats hold all but one state. office and control of the both houses of the Legislature. ""If you're going to. throw the bums out, the bums in this state are mostly Democrats."".

Rate Increases May Be Just Beginning. Unanswered questions now may mean higher bills soon. David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer. Sunday, April 1, 2001. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle.

When regulators passed an average 40 percent electricity rate increase last. week, they insisted this was the last time the state would be reaching into. consumers' pockets to pay for California's energy mess.. Don't bet on it.. Numerous questions remain about the costly bailout of the state's two largest. utilities and the billions of dollars in taxpayer money being spent to keep. California's juice flowing.. And a growing consensus has emerged: Rates almost certainly will go up again. before the worst is over.. ""Based on what the state and utilities have been paying for electricity, 40. percent doesn't come close to covering it,"" said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman. for Consumer Action in San Francisco. ""It's going to be a nightmare this. summer."". Indeed, Gov. Gray Davis admitted last week that there are ""a lot of moving. parts"" to California's energy equation, and that it is too soon to say. whether additional rate hikes will be required.. More tellingly, the governor, after doing his best to distance himself from. the latest rate increase, opened the door to supporting future increases that. are ""absolutely necessary for the good of the state."". MIXED MESSAGES. State leaders have yet to get their story straight. Earlier in the week,. Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission and a Davis. appointee, told The Chronicle that there probably would be no more rate hikes. this year.. ""We think this will cover everything,"" she said of the PUC's decision to. approve a new 30 percent rate increase and make permanent an average 10. percent ""temporary"" increase adopted in January.. The move will allow utilities to raise an extra $4.8 billion a year from. customers -- although it remains up in the air where the bulk of the money. will go.. Consumer advocates say state officials are kidding themselves if they think. California has solved its energy troubles.. ""This summer is when the energy companies will make the most mischief and. drive energy prices through the roof,"" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the. Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.. Based on his group's calculations, and the fact that the state is burning. through about $50 million a day buying power on behalf of cash-poor. utilities, he said it is not out of the question to believe power bills will. go as much as 100 percent higher.. ""There is no end in sight,"" Rosenfield said. ""We are at the mercy of economic. terrorists, and you can't bargain with terrorists."". State Controller Kathleen Connell estimated the state faces a $7.4 billion. shortfall if it keeps spending money hand over fist on the volatile. electricity ""spot"" market.. She predicted that the state will shell out nearly $27 billion over the next. 18 months to keep the lights on -- more than twice the amount in bonds that. California is authorized to sell to cover its payments.. Connell said she was ""troubled by the fact that consumers already are being. rocked by a substantial rate increase, and I don't want them assuming that's. the total exposure."". For example, state officials have yet to address the roughly $14 billion in. debt hanging over Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California. Edison. Last week's rate increase will not be applied to that thorny problem.. Moreover, despite a PUC ruling that the utilities must repay the state. Department of Water Resources for more than $4 billion in recent power. purchases, that too remains a question mark.. Still to be determined: How will the limited revenues collected from. ratepayers be disbursed among the state, the utilities and smaller power. companies that have had to shut down recently because they are owed millions. of dollars.. ""The state is at the front of the line,"" insisted Steve Maviglio, a spokesman. for the governor.. If so, this could leave the utilities and alternative energy providers with. nothing to cover their own expenses. The threat of bankruptcy, which has. hovered in the background for weeks, suddenly has become a more serious. concern.. NO GUARANTEE OF RELIEF. PG&E's chief executive, Gordon Smith, warned that even with higher rates, the. PUC's decisions to force payments to the state and change how the utility's. debt will be tabulated could exacerbate the situation.. ""The actions do not offer a comprehensive solution, fail to resolve the. uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability,"" he said.. On Friday, PG&E's parent company, PG&E Corp., said it may have to write off. more than $4 billion in debt because of the changes. The company also said it. would delay release of its annual report, which was due to be unveiled. tomorrow.. ""Every day, we calculate how this picture looks in Chapter 11 and out of. Chapter 11,"" PG&E's chief financial officer, Peter Darbee, told financial. analysts in a subsequent conference call. ""Thus far, we have concluded that. shareholders are better off out of Chapter 11."". That ""thus far"" rang out loud and clear among listeners. Without more cash,. many came away thinking, the likelihood of PG&E declaring bankruptcy is now. substantially higher.. ""The chance of further rate increases is certainly within the realm of. possibility,"" said Herbert Hart, research director at Redwood Securities. Group in San Francisco. ""Somewhere down the line, the PUC will have to act. again."". E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ? Page?A - 3. . -.

Experts say it may be the fuel of the future. Carl T. Hall, Chronicle Science Writer. Monday, April 2, 2001. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle. URL:. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/02/M. N107106.DTL. Hydrogen, the simplest atom, is everywhere. So perhaps it's not surprising. that the most abundant element in the universe would worm its way into the. midst of California's deepening energy crisis.. Rolling blackouts and skyrocketing utility rates are focusing new attention. on the risks of relying solely on the public power grid for electricity.. ""The California situation is enlightening a lot of businesses and individuals. about the need for an alternative energy source for backup or primary power,"". said Jim Kirsch, a vice president and head of a power generation unit at. Ballard Power Systems in Vancouver, British Columbia.. Many energy experts have long championed hydrogen's potential as a power. source - the key ingredient in hydrogen fuel cells that offer a. pollution-free alternative to batteries.. There's an emerging consensus that ""hydrogen will be the fuel of the future,. "" said Robert Stempel, the former chief executive of General Motors, now. chairman of Energy Conversion Devices Inc. in Troy, Mich.. New Respect for New Ideas. His company, a pioneer in portable electricity storage, formed a joint. venture with Texaco to develop solid-state, metal-hydride hydrogen storage. systems for powering clean-running vehicles. There are other methods, too,. but the real take-home lesson from the joint venture, according to Texaco CEO. Peter I. Bijur, is that oil companies now are embracing technologies ""that. just 20 years ago we brushed off as a weak threat to our industry."". Ultimately, the idea is to move away from fossil fuels and other traditional. energy sources toward what's known as a ""hydrogen economy,"" in which. renewable solar and wind generators might be used to produce pure hydrogen. fuel out of water.. If a practical hydrogen storage system can be perfected, and if fuel cells. can ever be mass-produced cheaply enough, today's utility customers would. have electricity in a stable, portable form capable of being used whenever. needed.. Imagine city streets full of fuel-cell powered vehicles, neighborhood-size. power plants using hydrogen, and homes and businesses with stacks of fuel. cells in the back yard or basement. These could augment and sometimes. supplant electricity supplied through the public grid and might even be wired. into a computer-guided ""distributed generation"" scheme via links to the. Internet.. No Quick Fix. All of that is clearly a distant vision. Fuel cells are not quite ready for. prime time. They are still expensive to make and the flammable hydrogen fuel. is difficult to handle.. But while nobody expects fuel cells to be California's power savior right. away, a few pieces of the ""hydrogen economy"" are already starting to take. shape.. The most widely touted fuel-cell technology to have emerged from the. laboratory stage so far uses what's known as a PEM - for proton or polymer. exchange membrane - situated between two electrodes, each coated with a. catalyst such as platinum or palladium.. When sandwiched together in this way, hydrogen fuel can be made to separate. at one electrode into its constituent free electrons and positively charged. hydrogen ions, also called protons.. The electrons can then be siphoned off as usable direct current electricity,. or converted to alternating current. The protons drift through the PEM,. combining with oxygen at the second electrode to produce ordinary water and. heat.. The individual fuel cells can be arranged in ""stacks"" of virtually any size.. There's no pollution, and no moving parts to wear out or break down.. Clean Chemistry. ""It's very clean and elegant chemistry,"" said Bill Smith, vice president of. business development at Proton Energy Systems in Connecticut.. The process is basically electrolysis in reverse. Similarly, hydrogen to. supply the fuel cells can be produced with electricity by cracking water. molecules in a device known as an electrolyzer.. ""Hydrogen represents stored energy,"" said chemist Peter Lehman, director of. the Schatz Energy Research Center at Humboldt State University. ""Energy. storage is not easy and it's not cheap."". Regular batteries are good for short-term storage, but they require too much. lead to manufacture and generate far too much pollution when discarded to be. practical for large-scale use. Other strategies - pumping water uphill, for. example, to run a turbine at a hydro station - work well only if. circumstances are ideal.. By contrast, the portable hydrogen fuel cell seems to represent the ideal. energy ""carrier"" in a natural cycle, Lehman said.. ""It's completely sustainable. If the input is solar energy, you end up with a. clean and dispatchable energy source,"" he said.. Driven partly by government clean-air standards and the need to reduce. hydrocarbon emissions, corporate America has embarked on a crash program to. turn fuel cells into practical products.. ""We don't consider it a fringe technology at all,"" said William M. Wicker,. senior vice president for global businesses at Texaco. ""Although the. traditional oil and gas business is not going away any time soon, hydrogen is. going to be a part of our energy future."". A hydrogen-based commercial backup power system is due out this year from. Ballard Power, ranked among the leaders in the nascent fuel-cell industry.. The new system is billed as a clean, noiseless alternative to portable diesel. generators. Rather than using water to produce hydrogen fuel, however, the. system produces its own hydrogen by breaking down an ordinary hydrocarbon. fuel, such as propane or natural gas, which the user has to supply.. Big Step Forward. It's clearly not the ideal hydrogen technology, and price and other details,. which have not been revealed, could put it out of reach of average consumers.. But Kirsch said the new portable backup system should still rank as an. important commercial breakthrough.. ""As far as we know, this will be the first hydrogen energy product a consumer. can walk in and purchase off the shelf,"" he said.. For many businesses, the disruptions in the California energy supply system. are only the latest reasons to embrace the idea of energy self-reliance. Many. are talking not in terms of the usual 99.9 percent reliability standard, but. rather a new ""six-nines standard"" of 99.9999 percent.. That's more than most utilities can deliver even in best of times. Hydrogen. advocates claim they have at least part of the answer, particularly when the. need to reduce energy pollution is taken into the equation.. ""The troubles in California really have shined a bright light on the hydrogen. story. People are looking for alternatives, and now they are going to be. seeing just how close we are to this technology,"" Kirsch said.. Just how close is arguable beyond a few niche markets.. ""The cost of manufacturing the fuel cell itself and the cost of fuel. processing are the two big problems we have to solve,"" Wicker said. ""They. aren't insurmountable problems at all but the solutions are pretty far in the. future."". Pure hydrogen has some ideal characteristics as an energy container, but. those same characteristics make it difficult to handle.. ""Hydrogen definitely has hazards,"" said Jeff Rinker, general manager of. hydrogen at BP, the international oil company, and chairman of the National. Hydrogen Association, a trade group. ""It would be good if someone came up. with an elegant method of storing hydrogen."". Even staunch wind and solar proponents say there's little practical need to. worry about fancy storage methods for intermittent supplies, because the. public grid has plenty of room for more electrons - even when the sun is. shining and the wind is blowing.. ""There is a great potential for hydrogen storage in the future, but today the. grid itself is capable of effectively being used as storage,"" said Alan. Nogee, director of clean energy programs at the Union of Concerned Scientists. in Washington, D.C.. ""Not until we start getting at least 15 percent of our energy from. intermittent sources is there any concern about reliability. Some regions in. Europe are getting over 20 percent and are still doing fine."". Hawaii in the Vanguard. Hydrogen's first large-scale commercial use is expected to be not in. California but rather in such locations as Iceland and Hawaii, where. renewables are much higher on the political radar.. Hawaii state Rep. Hermina Morita, a Democrat who chairs a legislative energy. committee, is leading the push to reduce her state's need for imported oil,. partly by encouraging alternatives and hydrogen fuel cells.. She described it as a ""market-based approach"" that includes demonstration. projects and economic incentives for utility investment. Eventually, she. added,. California could be part of the picture.. Rather than importing energy, she said, ""ultimately what we want in Hawaii is. to be capable of producing more hydrogen than we need, so we can send the. excess to California."". E-mail Carl T.

AMD STEVE JOHNSON. Mercury News. As state regulators prepare to decide in coming weeks who will bear the. burden of a massive new electricity-rate hike, a long line is beginning to. form of residents, business operators and others seeking a break.. The tiered plan proposed by Public Utilities Commission President Loretta. Lynch exempts those who use no more than 130 percent of their baseline''. allotment. But other residents could see increases up to 36 percent, while. commercial customers could pay even more.. Homeowners say there's no way they can save that much. Advocates for the poor. and elderly are crying foul. Businesses say they're already unfairly. burdened.. Residents now poring over their bills and baselines -- which are supposed to. represent average usage -- are puzzled and frustrated. While regulators say. almost half of households use no more than 130 percent of their baseline,. many energy misers wonder just who those people could be.. This just blows me away,'' said Ellen Finch of San Jose. I'm out of ways. to save, short of turning everything off. How on earth does an average. household function on the baseline rates? How many people does an average. household have -- zero?''. The 45-year-old technical writer has cut down dishwashing to once a week and. laundry to twice a week. She's pushed the thermostat down to 67 and put. blankets on every chair.. She's turned off lights and limited her computer, TV and stereo. Still, Finch. says she's using up to twice her baseline amount and expects her bill to go. up at least 9 percent, or about $12.. Utilities haven't yet calculated just how many residents would fall within. the 130 percent. Estimates range from 30 to nearly 50 percent.. Many residents still are trying to figure how their baselines work. Studying. past bills, they see different figures.. That's because the baselines are daily figures, and the number of days in. monthly billing cycles varies. In addition, the baselines change in May and. November to account for differences in summer and winter use.. It's very difficult for me to understand what this means to me. financially,'' said Bruce Capron, 69, of Cupertino.. Baselines were established in the early 1980s to promote conservation by. allowing utilities to charge higher rates for above-average consumption. It's. based on 50 percent to 60 percent of average usage within each of 19 climatic. territories'' in the state.. Baselines take into account the various energy needs caused by regional and. seasonal climatic differences. Also considered are whether a home has all. electric appliances or some powered by gas, as well as whether it is an. apartment or detached house. Customers with medical needs can apply for. additional baseline credits.. But baselines don't take into account the size of the home or number of. occupants. Some argue that unfairly punishes the poor, who often have to. share housing with large numbers of family and friends to make rent.. One of the things we do see as an issue is that a lot of low-income. families tend to have multiple families in a unit or larger families,'' said. Julia Macias, project director for energy issues at the Latino Issues Forum.. They tend to go over the baseline, not just because they are energy hogs,'. as Lynch calls them, but just because they have more people in the units,''. Macias said.. Because of language differences, many Latinos aren't aware of the exemptions. and other programs for low-income residents and don't apply for them, Macias. said. In addition, they tend to live in older and less efficient housing. And. for economic reasons, they're already doing what they can to save.. Low-income families tend to conserve as it is and so further conservation. tends to be really hard,'' Macias said. We would like to see something done. to make exceptions for people in those situations.''. Others have similar worries about the elderly, who tend to live on fixed. incomes in older and less-efficient housing, and face greater health risks. from extreme temperatures.. Seniors are going to be disproportionately affected by this,'' said Hoyt. Minkoff, program director with the Consumer Federation of California and. consultant to the Congress of California Seniors. Seniors typically are. going to be more vulnerable to the elements, and the hot weather is going to. affect them more than others. So they're going to need to run their air. conditioning and their fans more than others.''. Some argue the baseline system should take into account all the new. electronic gizmos, from computers to DVD players, that have become. commonplace in many modern homes.. But Pacific Gas & Electric Co. spokesman John Nelson says that's accounted. for because the baselines are recalculated regularly. Because it's based on. average usage within an area, if most people use more power, the baseline. will go up.. In fact, the baseline for the zone that includes Silicon Valley increased. slightly in the last 10 years, while the neighboring zone including San. Francisco hasn't changed, he said.. Commercial customers, who pay lower rates but would see a proportionately. greater increase, also are crying foul.. Grocers are upset because they had cut energy consumption 10 percent at the. request of Gov. Gray Davis last year, which means it will be that much harder. for them to further lower their electricity bills.. We had hoped it would be spread out more evenly, not so much focused on the. real heavy users,'' said Dave Heylen, spokesman for the California Grocers. Association. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of electricity to ensure a safe. food supply. The bulk of our energy use is geared toward cooler cases,. freezer cases, those types of things.''. Nursing homes argue they cannot afford the higher rates.. When they raise the electricity rates, we don't have any way of absorbing. the costs'' immediately, said Nancy Armentrout of the California Association. of Health Facilities. The government hasn't given us any money to. compensate for the increased cost of energy.''. But some consumer advocates argue that exempting various groups will only. cripple efforts to reward conservation.. It's a crude and blunt tool,'' said Nettie Hoge of The Utility Reform. Network..

BY MATT MOORE. Associated Press. NEW YORK -- Surging U.S. energy prices gave oil, gas and power companies new. fuel in their climb through the ranks of the annual Fortune 500 list of the. largest public corporations, released Sunday.. Oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. posted its highest-ever revenue of $210 billion. in 2000, boosting it to No. 1 on the list from its 1999 ranking as No. 3.. Automaker General Motors Corp. had revenue of $184.6 billion and fell from. No. 1 to No. 3.. Other energy companies also fared well in 2000, with Enron Corp. rising to. No. 7 from No. 18. Duke Energy Corp. shot up to No. 17 from 69, and Reliant. Energy Inc. made it up to No. 55 from 114.. The list of the largest public companies, ranked by fiscal year revenues, has. been compiled annually since 1955 by the editors of Fortune. GM, which had. held the top spot on the list for 15 years, now trails No. 2 Wal-Mart Stores. Inc.. Energy companies benefited from a surge in revenue brought about by falling. supplies, utility deregulation, soaring natural gas prices and OPEC's. maneuvering to keep oil prices high.. Other energy firms advancing included Texaco Inc., which went from No. 28 to. No. 16; San Francisco-based Chevron Corp., which was ranked No. 20, up from. No. 35; and Dynegy Inc., which rose to No. 54 from No. 112.. The Internet slowdown and uncertainty about the economy hurt a number of. companies, particularly telecommunications firms. AT&T Corp. fell from No. 8. to No. 9.. America Online Inc., which became the first purely Internet company to break. into the list last year at No. 337, rose to No. 271. Since then, it has. become AOL Time Warner Inc. with its acquisition of Time Warner. The combined. company's revenue of $36.2 billion would have made it No. 39 on the year 2000. list, but the deal didn't close until early this year.. Computer companies were led by International Business Machines Corp., which. stayed in the top 10 but fell from sixth last year to No. 8.. Microsoft Corp. rose to 79 from 84, and San Jose-based Cisco Systems Inc.. advanced to 107 from 146, despite the dot-com crash.. Total profits for the 500 corporations grew 8.4 percent for the year, down. from 1999's level of 28.7 percent, to $444 billion. Revenue grew by more than. 13 percent to a combined $7.2 trillion for 2000. They employed more than 24. million workers.. . . As energy policy lurches, is Gov. Davis in charge?. Published Monday, April 2, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News. BY PHIL YOST. OH SURE, there's progress in Sacramento on the electricity mess, says one. senator. There's less denial than there has been.''. This ends the Indisputably Good News'' portion of our column. The rest is. like an electrical circuit: Every positive is connected to a negative.. Three months after Gov. Gray Davis convened an extraordinary session of the. Legislature to jump on the energy crisis, the Capitol is full of trepidation. about the summer. Only the governor's office keeps pumping out optimism.. In January electricity was running short, prices fluctuated wildly on the. spot market, and the utilities were faced with bankruptcy unless consumers. started getting huge bills. Davis and the Legislature set out to find more. electricity, stabilize the market, establish the lowest possible prices, and. put the utilities back on their feet.. Some progress has been made on all those fronts. But in terms of what's. needed for this summer, things are not going all that well.. On finding more electricity, Davis has been trying to get peaker plants in. place for the summer. He thinks he'll have enough; hardly anyone else does.. Other events are conspiring against him. The forecasts for hydro power are. grim and grimmer.. Demand reduction, or conservation, is the flip side of supply. The behavior. of consumers this summer is a huge unknown. The behavior of the Legislature,. alas, is known. Only now is a bill to fund programs such as rebates for. energy efficient appliances nearing passage. It's a month late.. To rescue the utilities, stabilize the market and try to lower prices, the. state took over the utilities' job of buying electricity. How much it has. spent is Davis's big, dark secret. About a third of the state's electricity. must be bought on the open market. Davis's aides say the state has covered 75. percent of this need for the next 10 years. But for this summer, they've. found less than half of it.. Buying the transmission system from Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern. California Edison is the heart of the plan to put them back on their feet.. The utilities would get money; the state, an asset.. The main backer, John Burton, the Democratic president pro tem of the Senate,. wanted to do the deal willing buyer, willing seller.'' He's the most. willing buyer. Other key players, Davis included, are reluctant buyers. PG&E. is a grudging seller. The deal is amazingly complicated. It could fall apart.. On rates to consumers, Davis has been a pillar of jelly. Last week, the. Public Utilities Commission stepped up, as they say every 30 seconds on. sports broadcasts, and took rates to the next level.. While justified, the PUC decision left the impression that energy policy is. lurching in no particular direction. After weeks of hearing Davis reject rate. hikes, consumers learned of a potential increase on Monday -- if they were. attentive to the news -- and saw it enacted on Tuesday.. What is most critically lacking, after three months, is a sense that the. crisis is being managed from a central command post, with a coherent. strategy. Davis has not been the general the battle requires.. Some of his ideas have been off-point, like making businesses cut outside. lighting late at night.. Some of the successes are quickly reversed. He held a press conference to. announce an agreement on alternative power generators, some of which have not. been producing because they haven't been paid. The bill stalled the next day.. He seems oddly absent at times. When the PUC's intention to raise rates hit. the news Monday, Davis's press office issued a short release, in which he. said he hoped they wouldn't. After the PUC followed through, Davis, after. delaying all day, issued a brief statement wishing they hadn't.. Davis keeps asserting, against all evidence, that rate hikes might not be. necessary.. He said he couldn't determine whether the rate hikes were justified because. he didn't have enough data. Granted, the potential power supply and consumer. behavior, which will affect electricity prices, are uncertain. But. rate-setting involves assumptions about weather and conservation, among other. variables. Wrong rates can be adjusted later.. When the governor says that he doesn't know how much customers should be. charged for electricity, he's admitting he doesn't know where we are on the. path to getting through the summer.. Maybe Davis can pull a rabbit out of the hat before summer starts. If so,. give him credit for mastering the magician's technique of heightening the. suspense. Because right now, it's sure looking like all hat and no rabbit.. Phil Yost is chief editorial writer of the Mercury News.. . --. Businesses battle the blackouts. Monday, April 2, 2001. To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California. electricity crisis. Local businesses are suffering badly from the electricity crisis - and expect. even worse in the months ahead. That was the message the Register editorial. board received from a Thursday meeting with local business executives who. represent some of Orange County's larger electricity users.. It became apparent from our conversation that there is little if nothing. happening in the way of coordinated planning among state, utility and. business representatives as the summer fast approaches.. This could be extremely harmful to the California business climate. A truism. about business, so dependent on timely fulfillment of obligations to. customers, meeting tight manufacturing times, keeping equipment and inventory. at optimum use, is that business hates uncertainty.. And the likelihood of shortages and blackouts for summer portends nothing. but. On the other hand, businesses are good at crisis management and recovery. planning, if given the chance. In the case of the power crisis, however,. where so much is out of control, they can't plan without collaboration from. the state and the utilities.. Here's how alarming the situation is shaping up for business owners, two of. whom told us they are building their plans around the potential for as many. as 30 blackouts in months ahead - a guess, they admit, but planning has to. start somewhere.. ""Last year we spent $800,000 on electricity and expect to spend another. $490,000 this year,"" for a combined cost of $1.29 million, Richard J. Collins. told us; he's president and CEO of Astech Inc. in Santa Ana, which. manufactures exhaust systems for Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The higher cost. stems from the March 27 announcement by the California Public Utilities. Commission that rates will rise as much as 46 percent across the state.. The increase will consume ""a quarter of my total operating profit"" for the. year, Mr. Collins lamented. ""We have long-term agreements and no flexibility. to raise prices."". Blackouts will wreak the worst harm, given that they come without warning and. prompt immediate hard shutdown of equipment, in Mr. Collins' case, furnaces. used in a 30-hour manufacturing process. ""If there's a blackout, there's. damage to the furnace,"" he said.. Furthermore, because he doesn't know when the blackouts come, ""I don't know. when to bring my people into work. There's no basis to plan my business."". The problem will become most acute this summer when rolling blackouts are. expected to be severe across the state. Astech is conserving power as best it. can. It participates in the interruptible power program with Edison, by which. businesses agree to do cut power to an agreed-upon level during peak periods. in exchange for lower rates.. And, the company is ""investing $250,000 in generating equipment"" to produce. some of its own power, especially during blackouts. He has no plans to leave. Orange County. ""It's ideal being where we are. We like where we are,"" he. maintained.. We asked what might happen if the price doubled. ""But there comes a point. where we'll have to go somewhere else,"" he said.. ""You need reliability and you need predictability,"" Andrew De Cicco, vice. president and general counsel for ITT Cannon in Santa Ana, told us. His. company spent about $2 million on electricity last year but will spend about. $3.2 million this year because of the PUC price increase. His company has. acquired a diesel generator on a one-year lease - and is even weighing the. idea of building a power plant.. ""Cannon has a long history in California, dating back to 1915,"" he said, and. plans to continue here. ""The question is the future, the appropriate level of. investment. For that you do need reliability and predictability in the. business climate."". Government officials, regulators and electricity industry executives need to. understand that, although these and other business are tenacious about. staying in California and expanding operations here, their resources are not. unlimited. In addition to the obvious - building more generating plants -. three major policy changes and one clarification of policy are needed to keep. businesses producing and creating jobs:. * Give companies an hour's notice before any blackout to give them some time. to power down computers and machines in an orderly way. We understand there. are concerns about security - preventing hoodlums from using the blackout. notification time to loot homes with shut-down security systems - but there. are successful ways to give advance notice. Something needs to be done, such. as rotating blackout groups.. * Plan ahead. Businesses are expressing a willingness to voluntarily shut. down operations for a given period, say, a specified week or two during the. summer, if they can be guaranteed uninterrupted power during the remainder of. the worst months. ""We can organize around that,"" Mr. Collins said. ""Somebody. could organize that to shed load"" from the statewide system. ""Sign people. like us up for a two-week period."". * Extend the maximum period companies can use small generators to 1,000 hours. from 200 hours a year. The AQMD limit of 200 exists because portable. generators, usually diesel, cause more pollution. But this summer power needs. clearly will be at emergency levels.. * Make clearer permit conditions from the Air Resources Board regarding use. of alternate power sources, such as diesel generators. Anything that can be. done to allow alternate sources of energy to go on line and stay on line. would help restore some reliability and predictability to business planning.. California industry is going to have major electricity problems no matter. what. But these changes could make the difference between success and. failure, not only for these companies but for our state's economy.. --. California ISO Declares Stage Two Electrical Emergency; Continued. Conservation Urged as Power Supplies Remain Limited. FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 30, 1001 via NewsEdge Corporation -. At 9:00 a.m.. today, Friday, March 30, 2001 the California Independent System. Operator (California ISO) called a Stage Two Emergency as operating. reserves dipped below five percent. This emergency status is. attributable to the loss of more than 700 megawatts of wind generation. that was helping to keep the Electrical Grid balanced while supply. limitations continued throughout the state:. -- A total of 11,500 megawatts worth of generation remains. unavailable today with power plants off-line because of. preventative repairs and plant malfunctions. -- An additional 3,000 megawatts of generation from the state's. qualifying facilities (QFs) remain unavailable due to. continuing financial concerns. With operating reserves hovering at critical levels, the. California ISO requests that customers voluntarily reduce their use of. electricity to prevent more severe curtailment measures. Peak demand. on the transmission system is expected to reach 28,661 megawatts. around 6:00 p.m. today. Today's Stage Two declaration, expected to be. in effect until midnight, enables the California ISO to access. emergency resources to help maintain operating reserves.. If an operating reserve shortfall of less than one-and-a-half. percent is unavoidable, Stage Three is initiated. Involuntary. curtailments of service to customers including ""rotating blackouts"". are possible during this emergency declaration. The California ISO's. Electrical Emergency Plan (EEP) is part of the state's enhanced. reliability standards enacted by landmark legislation Assembly Bill. 1890 that led to the restructuring of California's electricity. industry.. The California ISO is charged with managing the flow of. electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that. make up the bulk of California's transmission system. The. not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility. in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets to. competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their. private transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage.. The mission of the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable. delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and ensure equal access to. a 25,526 circuit mile ""electron highway."". Continuously updated information about the California ISO control. area's electricity supply and the current demand on the power grid is. available on the web at www.caiso.com.. --. [B] PG&E says it will take $4.1 bln charge on uncollected power costs (Wrap). By Christine Cordner. San Francisco, March 30 (BridgeNews) - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said Friday. that it will take a $4.1 billion after tax charge in the fourth quarter of. 2000, tied to uncollected power costs, without a regulatory or legislative. solution that provides for the full recovery of such costs.. On Tuesday, the California Public Utilities Commission approved a rate. increase that would provide the state's near-bankrupt utilities with much. needed extra revenue.. However, PG&amp;E said they would not be able to use revenues from the rate. hike to pay off existing debt and do not have the authority to recover. power purchase costs incurred above revenue from retail rates. Gains generated. from the hike are to be used only for the costs incurred after March 27.. PG&amp;E. estimated that, as of Feb. 28, it had undercollected for wholesale power. purchases by $8.9 billion.. PG&amp;E Corp., the parent company of California's largest utility, said it. would not file its annual report as expected on April 2 due to Tuesday's. ruling. from the California PUC. It now expects to file the earnings report by April. 17, after taking the new ruling into account.. The utility's cash reserves are only $2.6 billion, while it expects to add. an additional $1.5 billion in obligations due and payable through April 30 on. top of the $4.4 billion in debt it currently has on its books. The new debt. includes $550 million payable to the California Independent System Operator. (CAISO), $340 million to small power producers and $470 million to natural gas. suppliers.. PG&amp;E said that the $8.9 billion undercollection reflects estimated charges. from the Independent Systems Operator for power purchased through February. 2001. to meet the amount of its net open position not met through the state. Department of Water Resource's purchases.. The utilities have lost billions of dollars because the retail rates. they're allowed to charge customers have been frozen at 1996 levels and the. wholesale prices they must pay for power have jumped as much as 60-fold.. The higher wholesale prices have sent PG&amp;E to the brink of bankruptcy.. Shares of its parent PG&amp;E Corp. fell 6% to $11.84 on Friday. End. [slug: PG&amp;E-Q4-CHARGE]. ?"

67465	2	"SENDER START dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Questions SUBJECT END Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.. Please look it over and let's talk. The items are not prioritized in any way.. 1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR. the. price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I. The same is true for delivery. points into Michcon. Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7. plus. the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon? Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7. as the price index for Michcon.. 2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:. TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12. However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes. for. these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to. Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1. Exhibit 1 contains. projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000. Are we required. to. do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense. with. this? I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency. Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.. 3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are. incorrect. The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume. Since. the. supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy. and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend. to do a simultaneous ""buy/sell"" with Enron of the volumes in excess of the. (erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume. If you disagree, let's discuss.. 4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21. (O&R), TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please. provide. me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly. basis. for April at each of these points? (I also need these numbers for January,. February, and March.). 5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?. 6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas. was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for. that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?. There will undoubtedly be other questions. I will direct them to you as they. arise.. Thanks.. Doug Kinney. Ph: 703-561-6339. Fax: 703-561-7317"

218910	1	SENDER START jeff.dasovich@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START FW: Assigned Commissioner's Ruling Requiring That Direct Access C ontr acts And Agreements Be submitted in A.98-07-003 et al. SUBJECT END We're in the process of working with market participants (i.e., ESPs, large customer groups, etc.) to figure this out. There are many thorny legal issues that need to be worked out and many regulatory lawyers are combing over the implications, options, etc. Our goal is to come up with a solution that:. 1) meets the Commission's objectives of administering the DA suspension date of 9.20.01.. 2) gives the Commission the information it needs to administer the suspension without requiring customers to submit specific contract language (which the Commission doesn't need to administer the suspension). 3) gives customers full flexibility to use contract provisions entered into with ESPs. 4) fully protects confidential commercial information contained in the contracts. In general, there appears to be considerable reluctance on the part of the industry to submit contracts to the California Commission, which doesn't regulate either counterparty.. In short, the issues are tough and complex. We're meeting first thing with groups next week, and presumably, we can get back to our customers soon thereafter with more info.. Mike Smith likely has additional insights from the legal perspective.. If there are any other questions, let us know.. Best,. Jeff. --

42213	0	"SENDER START schwabalerts.marketupdates@schwab.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Internet Daily for December 26, 2001 SUBJECT END Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.. Email Alert. Internet Daily. for Wednesday, December 26, 2001. by Frank Barnako CBS MarketWatch.com. Sites tout strong online holiday sales. Yahoo says visitors spent $10.3 billion online in the fourth. quarter, beating analysts' expectations of 10% growth by more. than eight times. Sales volume during the period running from. Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve was up 86% compared to the same. period last year, said Rob Solomon, vice president and general. manager of Yahoo Shopping. He said bargain hunting was a major. driver this season -- and one to which his site is catering. after Christmas. Yahoo launched a post-holiday sales center. Wednesday morning, through which it will offer discounts of 50%. to 75% on items from Banana Republic, Old Navy and SonyStyle.. Yahoo will also open an Unwanted Gifts showcase on its auction. site. ""Consumers can auction off their undesirable gifts and. shop for products they really want,"" Solomon said.. Separately, comparison shopping site BizRate.com's estimate of. online shopping was similar to Yahoo's. During the weekend. before Christmas, online shopping transactions were valued at. $345 million, a gain of 73% compared to last year, BizRate.com. said. Another interesting factoid: 52% of the shoppers were men.. Meanwhile, Terra Lycos said results of its online shopping. season confirmed early predictions that bargain hunting would be. in the forefront of consumers' minds were right on target. ""The. tone and attitude of this season was different,"" said Kim Kluck,. group product manager for Lycos Shopping. Moreover, she said. there was plenty of evidence of cocooning. ""The values of giving. and gathering, or keeping family close together and safe at the. holidays, emerged early,"" she said.. --. Media Metrix makes accuracy revisions. Web audience-measurement company Jupiter Media Metrix has. decided to separately report Web site visits generated by. pop-up, pop-under and other ""involuntary"" means. Previously, the. company's listings of Web properties included sites that use. such advertising techniques. The decision to include such. traffic in a new ""promotional servers"" category reflects. adaptation to ""the evolving Internet landscape and industry's. needs,"" Media Metrix said. Sites in this category will not. appear in any of the company's other measured categories, but it. will include sites that sell email lists, opt-in email. providers, image servers and promotional links.. Media Metrix also said it would include elements of major portal. sites in its popularity ranking of Web sites by category of. content. This means traffic to the personal-finance, real-estate. and travel portions of AOL Time Warner's America Online,. Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, Yahoo and others will be reported as if. they were stand-alone properties in those categories. The reason. to do this, said Will Hodgman, president of the company's. measurement business, is demonstrated by the finding that AOL. properties ranked among the top 10 in 37 categories, while. Microsoft and MSN-branded components were in the top 10 in 30. categories, and Yahoo's placed in 10 of the top 30 as well.. ""This will provide the most accurate snapshot and reliable. performance metrics to meet the needs of all companies with a. stake online,"" he said.. --.

124594	1	SENDER START louise.kitchen@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START RE: ibuyit or IT SUBJECT END Just so you know, I am nearer the bottom of the issue.. A user of ibuyit can select whether they want new equipment or old equipment. So I surveyed our assistants - obviously more than ours up here, to see if any of them knew that you could order OLD equipment instead of NEW. None of them did, including TJ Black who has since I have been receiving my weekly reports ordered the most IT equipment.. Jenny's group is to some extent relying upon this selection to buy the equipment. Don Black's equipment was bought new even though he is about to move but will get used in remote offices where they have no flat panels. So the buying is done by EA and someone else is benefitting.. As there is no way around ibuyit, I think we need a default where we use old equipment instead of new equipment.. As no-one replied to my previous email - I live in hope.. Thanks. Louise. --
229644	2	"SENDER START mark.taylor@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Online Trading contracts SUBJECT END Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online. system. I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most. recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that. I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date. They do have the advantage of. being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today. I don't. think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as. starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest. material.. The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective. counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper. The first time the. counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required. to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an ""I. Agree"" box after scrolling through the agreement. The GTC's are the. contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master. agreement in place. Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty. to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary. While. most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our. ""Omnibus"" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a ""Deemed. ISDA."" One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two. sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have. no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is. not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call. for collateral if we choose."

14397	2	"SENDER START sally.beck@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START HPL Sale - Energy Operations Task List SUBJECT END I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL. Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol"" into these discussions. To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document. Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc. Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).. Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented. Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May. He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement. As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review. Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.. We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you. This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues. Items that only require actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list. Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress. Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler. I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"". We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.. I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale. To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:. 1) Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full understanding of operational transition items and their status, or. 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.. Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week."

Add the following to the fourth bullet under Section A2.1 - (Deference to the WSCC where existing procedure require notification of bilateral payback to be made via the WSCC Messaging network, amounts are limited to 25 megawatts per hour unless all parties are notified are exempt from being tagged. Amount in excess of 25 megawatts per hour will be tagged.) The NERC IS's general consensus is that all schedules should be tagged.. NERC IS accepted the WSCC's Timetable to be included in V5 of policy 3 for 1.7 E-tagging with the TISWG/OSC changes.. E-Tag Implementation delay to November 13, 2001:. The primary reason for delaying the implementation of E-Tag 1.7 is the lack of a complete Registry.

Each Weather Forecast Used Within the Volatility Matrix Day 1-5 Discuss=. ion: A very healthy spring/winter storm to deal with in the short term. T=. his storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in=. terms of cold. A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =. Central Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and =. record warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southe=. rn Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of wint=. er weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois=. . More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the=. week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significan=. t freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas t=. o just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain=. ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse=. the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly =. expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the eart=. h shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have tren=. ded warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap =. from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what =. we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that=. has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above n=. ormal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but it sho=. uld not be as cold as the last couple of days.

WS still have a warm bias to them. There is not a big snow cover on the gro=. und, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=. ada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=. sitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a ""Clippe=. r Type"" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can somet=. imes be more prodigious snow makers than the big ""Plains type"" counterpart =. we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the =. Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to predict this far ou=. t. Other than this system, I don't see much action in the 6-10 day period. =.

227491	1	SENDER START christian.yoder@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Heads Up SUBJECT END As you are already aware, the West desk is making efforts to introduce. financial trading. I met with a customer of John Malowney's this afternoon,. a fellow from a small Oregon PUD named Clatskanie, (pronounced clask, as in. ask, uh nigh ) the name of a tribe of Indians that I am sure Lewis and Clark. dealt with on their way down river in 1805 and about which I will hereby. discipline myself to digress no further except to mention in passing that. there is an excavation site of one of their villages alluded to in the. Journals, not far from the Portland airport) anyway, this customer is. reviewing an ISDA and says there is an association of Oregon utilities that. share legal counsel and they are all edging ahead with ISDA review. One gets. the sense of a kind of imperceptible glacial movement turning into visible. creeping . I stepped up to the plate and said Enron legal would leave no. stone unturned in working with their association and we would be happy to get. our ISDA attorney's in Houston to work on a cost effective basis with their. association to promote this ISDA eductation process and on and on. He said. he would give my card to various lawyers and call us back. So, this is a. heads up about what may become an important opportunity for us to creep. somewhat more rapidly into the financial trading market up here. I realize. that resources in the financial trading group are spread thin but would like. to urge you to keep this kind of western initiative in mind. Wouldn't it be. ironic if the first city to string an electric wire (14 miles from Willamette. Falls at Oregon City, capital of the Oregon Territory, to downtown Portland). for the public sale of electricity would lead the charge to embracing. financial power trading? I will keep you posted and try not to write. messages so soon after drinking Starbuck coffee. .--cgy

I too want the subcommittees to address the more detailed issues and to. bring issues to the full committee as appropriate. In many instances, this. is what is happening. However, as you know, the members of the full. committee often want to discuss topics in detail and I try to give everyone. an opportunity to voice their views, while at the same time trying to move. things along. I am sure that everyone is busy and brings up items to. discuss during the committee meetings only when they think they are. important enough to take up the time of the full committee. We all owe that. to each other.. At our next meeting, I will propose to schedule the regular calls two weeks. apart, with the understanding that we can schedule more frequent meetings. when necessary. Thanks for the suggestion.. - winmail.dat
27781	3	SENDER START dale.m.davis@williams.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Order RM96-1-019 (Partial Day Recalls) - BPS Schedule is Official & Pipeline Segment Meeting SUBJECT END Following is info on BPS, Pipeline Segment and EC meetings in April / May.. FYI - On the Triage call this afternoon, Kim announced the following BPS. schedule for dealing with the recall order:. ** Wed 4/3 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central - agenda - only to identify. the issues and not to work on any of the issues at this point. ** Wed/Thurs 4/10 - 4/11 face to face @ Con Ed in NYC. ** Wed 4/24 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central. ** Tues/Wed 4/30-5/1 face to face in Houston - probably @ CMS. Kim indicated that on the 4/24 call we'd know better what additional. meetings might be needed. I suggested that since the Technical and IR are. meetings are in Houston Mon May 13 (Tech) and Tues/Wed May 14-15 (IR), that. if there needs to be another face to face about that time, that we could. possibly have it that Thursday and Friday (May 16-17) in Houston. Stay tuned. on any dates after the May 1 meeting.. Kim is going to try to have the NAESB office post this schedule this. afternoon.. ** Kim also asked me to remind everyone about the Pipeline Segment meeting. to prepare for the BPS meetings (see her e-mail of 3/15/02). Date: 3/27/2002. Time: 9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. central. Location: CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line. 5444 Westheimer, Houston, 77056. Please check in with the 7th floor receptionist.. Conference calling will be available. If you have not done so already,. please send Kim an email letting her know if you will attend in person or. via conference call.. ** Last but not least, April EC meeting - the NAESB web page shows it as. being a 2-day meeting - Thursday 4/18 and Friday 4/19. I confirmed with Jim. Buccigross this morning that it will only be a one day meeting on Thursday. 4/18 in DC.. Have a great weekend and keep those travel departments busy.

209524	2	SENDER START seabron.adamson@frontier-economics.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Policy paper - unit commitment SUBJECT END Rick:. Regarding this call tomorrow: are you going to be on this?. I gather from Jim there is a lot of worry about saying anything about how. the unit commitment process works (if it is in a centralized fashion).. That's fine, but I just wanted to get your own views on this. I wrote this. in response to the idea that we were looking for something quick and. effective to put in ASAP. The closer the parallels to working markets (e.g.. PJM) the better. That to me means following the PJM model fairly closely,. and not diverging into other tracks on the RTO process. However, I see how. people like Sue Mara are going to be very upset about this.. We can develop some other options (and they are being proposed in many of. the RTO debates around the country), but I don't want us to end up. advocating things that either won't work, are very complicated to design and. implement (e.g. the California system, with re-dispatch iterations etc.), or. just plain don't make sense. I guess the next question is how to present. this to Steve Kean.. Anyway, as tomorrow's call seems to be controversial it might be useful to. have a chat first. I should be in the office most of the afternoon, or you. can reach me on (617) 513-5904 (cellphone).. Seabron

Crockett, CA 94525. duchess6206@yahoo.com. To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. simone brooks

NOFX deliver punk with panache. NOFX (House of Blues; 1,000 capacity; $22.50). By Troy J. Augusto. HOLLYWOOD (Variety) - If there's one band that modern punk-rock concert-goers. can always count on for a good time, it's L.A.'s NOFX, whose fusion of. musical influences and tightly delivered mix of humor and melody leaves most. other bands in their dust.. At the second of three sold-out House of Blues shows on Sunday, the. three-chord quartet, which formed in the Bay Area in the mid-1980s, showed. the result of years of nonstop touring by ripping through an action-packed. hour-plus set.. The all-ages gig featured a fan-approved selection of popular catalog songs. (Linoleum,'' Don't Call Me White,'' It's My Job to Keep Punk Rock. Elite,'' The Brews'') from their many independently released albums and. EPs, each generating the usual mosh-pit activities on the dance floor. (Venue. security types were busy all night ejecting the rabble-rousers.). The set list was rounded out with a few choice cuts from last year's. excellent Pack Up the Valuum'' (Epitaph) collection, like the twisted love. tune Pharmacist's Daughter,'' about a guy who dates a girl so he can get. drugs from her daddy, What's the Matter With Parents Today'' and. Louise,'' one of bassist-singer Fat Mike's many graphic tributes to. lesbians.. Besides the humor, band stands out from the pack with impressive vocal. harmonies (even as they sing kill all the white man''), outstanding. songwriting, and the players' aptitude on their instruments, not exactly a. strength for most punk outfits. Four or five songs even boasted guitarist El. Hefe blowing smooth on trumpet.. Playful show ended with the new album's final track, Theme From a NOFX. Album,'' an autobiographical party limerick with an oom-pah-pah'' flow that. pretty much summed up the band's fortunes. We're professional punkers, we. come from the suburbs, after 15 years we're still having fun.''. Presented inhouse. Band: Fat Mike, Eric Melvin, El Hefe, Erik Ghint. Opened.

130187	2	"SENDER START stelzer@aol.com SENDER END SUBJECT START October London meeting SUBJECT END Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them. after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very. preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK. colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting. your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions.. I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening. dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the. facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip. for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative.. We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the. viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political. side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations. (characterized as ""a VERY smart guy on climate""):. Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC. Has been on UK. climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful).. Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out;. big figure in Europe).. Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and. can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or. Brenton).. Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam. Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul. also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the. French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good. presenter and a good economist.. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET. ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON. THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A. USEFUL TOPIC.. I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: ""I remember. promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be. interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council. about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly. on the Continent, to the U.S. model. I got the following names from Jay. Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty. Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as. possibilities. Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of. Henkel, very senior), Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam. Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse. Coopers - would be the most junior of the three. I don't personally know any. of the three."". Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a. two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a. run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better. understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face.. 1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great. interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We. might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if. allowed to do so.. 2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above).. 3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy.. 4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk).. 5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and. how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just. joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way.. 6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If. this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers.. 7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of. US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me,. we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and. the inventor of the ""climate change levy"" that is driving industry in this. country nuts.. Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with. Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum,. which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve. and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with. Ken at his convenience.. END"

48496	0	"SENDER START truorange@aol.com SENDER END SUBJECT START True Orange, October 1, 2001, Part 1 of 3 SUBJECT END Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange. The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful. Volume 11, No. 25, October 1, 2001. Longhorns Blast Raiders, Run Record to 4-0;. Huge Showdown with OU Looms Saturday. Junior QB Chris Simms completed his first 10 passes and 235-pound sophomore. RB Ivan Williams bulled for 152 yards and two touchdowns to spark Texas to a. 42-7 victory over Texas Tech Saturday night in Austin.. Simms had his sharpest performance as a Longhorn, completing 21 of 26 passes. for 224 yards and a touchdown, and scoring two TDs on 1-yard sneaks.. It also was easily Williams' best game. His strong runs gave the Longhorns. such balance that they scored on their first three possessions and kept the. Raiders' defenders guessing all night.. The Longhorn defense, coming out in a 3-4 and inserting sensational freshman. LB Derrick Johnson in place of DT Maurice Gordon, also rebounded strongly. after last week's poor showing in the victory over Houston.. The victory ran Texas' record to 4-0 for the first time since 1983.. But getting to 5-0 will prove a monumental task for the No. 5 Longhorns. because they will face defending national champion and No. 3-rated Oklahoma. Saturday at 2:30 p.m. in the teams' traditional showdown in the Cotton Bowl. in Dallas (see OU scouting report in second part). Defensive coordinator Carl Reese, a staunch advocate of man-for-man pass. defense, fed Texas Tech's high-octane offense a steady dose of zone coverages. Saturday night.. He also got to use his favored man-for-man defense on occasion, but it was. primarily a tight zone with a lot of different looks that was responsible for. holding the Raiders to seven points.. The Longhorn defenders kept the dangerous Tech receivers in front of them,. making them catch the ball in the short flat most of the time, then try to. use their speed to make something big happen.. The Raiders' problem is that this Texas defense is speedy, too, and those. two-yard catches often became four-yard gains.. Consider these telling statistics - the Raiders couldn't run (11 carries for. 36 net yards) and they threw 58 passes, completing 40 of them for 260 yards.. That's a net gain of just under 4.5 yards per pass and it's exactly 6.5 yards. per completion.. Raider coach Mike Leach, who had poked fun at Texas CBs Quentin Jammer and. Rod Babers and QB Chris Simms in pre-game comments, gave them little credit. in his post-game interview, then bristled when a Lubbock reporter asked him. about all the short passes Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury threw.. ""I don't know who all those experts are that know so much about going. vertical,"" Leach said. ""I would guess I know a lot more about going vertical. than they do. With that being the case, I thought we went vertical the right. number of times."". Their longest pass completion was 25 yards and they only scored 7 points, so. maybe they did and maybe they didn't.. What he didn't say was that the swarming UT defense didn't give the Raiders. much chance to go deep - or vertical - in his terminology.. Here, briefly, is how the game went. First Quarter. The Longhorns won the toss and deferred, so Tech took the ball. The UT. defense forced a quick punt. Simms led the Longhorns 80 yards in 11 plays,. hitting five straight passes, all of them to WR Roy Williams, for 49 yards.. Ivan Williams got the other 31 yards on six bullish runs, including the final. two yards for the TD. Dusty Mangum's kick gave Texas a 7-0 lead with 7:49. left. After another Tech punt, the Longhorns struck again, going 74 yards in. nine plays. Simms was 3-for-3 on the drive, hitting WR B. J. Johnson twice. for 23 yards and TE Bo Scaife once for 5 yards. But Ivan Williams had the big. play, a 30-yard run to the Raiders' 21. Simms got the TD on a 1-yard run.. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-0 lead with 1:26 left. The Longhorns totally. dominated the quarter, leading 8-3 in first downs, 77-20 in rushing yardage,. 77-44 in passing yardage and 154-64 in total offense. But the Raiders were. driving for the first time as the quarter ended.. Second Quarter. Tech's Ricky Williams squirted through a huge hole on a fourth-and-1 and. dashed 31 yards for a touchdown on the second play of the quarter, cutting. the UT lead to 14-7 just 33 seconds deep. But the Longhorn offense retaliated. immediately. Victor Ike returned the kickoff to the UT 47, and Simms found. Roy Williams with a 40-yard TD pass two plays later. Mangum's kick gave Texas. a 21-7 lead with 13:00 left. Tech drove to the UT 9 late in the half, but LBs. DeAndre Lewis and Tyrone Jones stopped Kingsbury a yard short of a first down. on a keeper that got to the UT 7. Simms was 13 for 15 for 130 yards and a. touchdown at the half. TE Bo Scaife who had 5 receptions for 64 yards, had a. rare drop, and Simms' other incompletion was one he threw away under a big. rush.. Third Quarter. The Longhorns put the game on ice with two touchdowns in a 46-second span. early in the second half. They drove 80 yards in 10 plays to start the half.. Ivan Williams got the touchdown on a 1-yard run. He had six carries for 39 y. ards on the drive and Simms hit Scaife twice for 37 yards. Mangum's kick gave. Texas a 28-7 lead with 10:44 left. Derrick Johnson ripped the ball out of. Ivory McCann's grasp on the kickoff and walk-on Richard Hightower recovered. at the Tech 13. Williams carried twice to the 1, then Simms scored on a. sneak. Mangum's kick put UT on top, 35-7, with 9:58 left. Neither team. threatened again in the quarter.. Fourth Quarter. Tech drove to the Texas 15 early in the fourth quarter, but a fourth-down. pass fell incomplete. Texas came back with a 12-play, 85-yard scoring drive.. Simms gave way to Major Applewhite during the drive. Ike got the touchdown on. a 1-yard run. Redshirt freshman RB Sneezy Beltran got his first three carries. of the year on the final Texas' possession, netting six yards.. Game Quotes . .. ""We didn't play as well as we should have tonight. We got stopped at key. times on all sides of the ball and didn't play together as well as Texas did.. The Longhorns deserve a lot of credit for their effort."". - Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach. * * * *. ""These spread offenses are like the wishbone. If they know what you're doing. and where you're going to line up, they'll get you. With that kind of. offense, you've got to play around a little, give them a two-man rush, a. three-man rush, just keep them guessing. We've got another offense like that. coming up this week (Oklahoma). We can't just do the same things we did. tonight. We'll have to come up with some new wrinkles."". - Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese. * * * *. ""We ran for more than 200 yards and we passed for more than 200 yards. Chris. (Simms) played extremely well. I think his best game is yet to come. He gets. better each week. I think he's playing within himself."". - UT offensive coordinator Greg Davis, talking about the offense in general. and answering a question about whether this was Simms' best game. * * * *. ""The line did a great job of blocking. We go out every Saturday and play the. game like it's the national championship game. OU will be a great game and. we're looking forward to the challenge."". - Longhorn RB Ivan Williams, who had a career best 152 yards rushing. * * * *. ""We showed them some things they hadn't seen before from us. It was a lot of. fun.."". - Texas' senior LB De'Andre Lewis. * * * *. ""Roy (Williams) split the two safeties. They gave us the look we wanted. It. was a great call by coach (Greg Davis). They gave us the middle of the field. all night."". - UT QB Chris Simms, talking about his 40-yard touchdown pass to Roy Williams. and the Raider defense. * * * *. ""It's not like getting an extra cornerback in there, but our linebackers are. all pretty fast. It was a lot of fun getting to play most of the game.. - UT freshman LB Derrick Johnson, who got his first start, talking about the. 3-4 defense. * * * *. ""They did what they needed to do, running and passing the football. We got a. tail kicking."". - Tech defensive coordinator Greg McMackin. * * * *. ""We had opportunities, but we struggled in the red zone early. In the second. half, the wheels just came off. I have to take my hat off to the Longhorns.. They played a great game tonight."". - Raider QB Kliff Kingsbury. 900 Number Updated Daily. I update my 900 number every day with football and football recruiting news.. The number is 1-900-288-8839. It costs $1.59 a minute. You must be 18 or. older to call.. Coach's Corner. Coach Mack Brown said Sunday a thorough study of Saturday night's game film. by all of the Texas coaches showed ""nearly everybody played well"" for the. Longhorns.. He also said the team has improved since the beginning of the season and said. it is important that it continue to improve.. ""We feel good about where we are,"" he said. ""We'll know a lot more after. Saturday because this will be by far the best team we have played."". He was referring, of course, to the upcoming meeting in Dallas with Oklahoma.. Brown said it was really important for the players to focus on the Texas Tech. game last week.. ""We're really excited about the way the guys played,"" he said. ""It was a. tough game to play because so many people were already talking about the. Oklahoma game."". ""We told our team last week the OU game wouldn't be nearly as important to us. if we didn't beat Texas Tech, and Texas Tech is a good football team that we. knew would come in here and play us hard."". He said the Longhorns new 3-4 defense, with freshman LB Derrick Johnson. replacing DT Maurice Gordon, worked great against Tech because ""it gave us. more speed."". Against more run-oriented teams, he said the Longhorns' base defense will. still be the 4-3.. ""We felt going into the kind of offenses we're going into (Tech and. Oklahoma), we needed to change it up, play some zone, try to give the. quarterback some indecision and keep the ball in front of us."". ""We've been using it since the spring, but we didn't feel like we needed it. against Houston,"" Brown said.. He also said the three starting linebackers, all seniors ""have been playing. the best since we've been here."" He said Johnson ""is just so talented that we. needed to get him in there, and we can do that in a 3-4 with an extra. linebacker."". ""We've been losing three games a year since we got here,"" Brown said. ""In the. games we lose, we've been giving up too many big plays, playing too much man. for man."". He said the use of some zone coverages in the secondary helps the defensive. backs ""keep the receivers in front of them, helps eliminate some of those big. plays."". Offensively, he said the Horns are much better this year than they were last. year at this time.. ""Chris (Simms) has a lot more experience. The receivers have more. experience,"" he said. ""We're blocking better, we're running better. Last year. we weren't able to run the ball consistently and we had one quarterback who. was hurt some (Major Applewhite) and one who hadn't played much (Simms), and. that really hurt us."". He said Simms is playing much better than he did early last year and he said. the emergence of TE Bo Scaife has helped the offense.. Scaife was supposed to be a weapon last year, but suffered a season-ending. knee injury during the pre-season drills.. ""My goal, and the assistant coaches' goal, is to make this team the best team. it can be,"" he said. ""We also want to continue to improve, to be a better. team at the end of the year than we were at the beginning."""

As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15. It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).. Here is the other part of my plans. I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short. I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself. Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.. I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January. That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary. Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements. I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there. Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.. I am totally terrified about traveling by myself -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time. I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.. I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport. Will the assistance service help me at customs? Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him? Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?. Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.

123158	1	"SENDER START robert.johnston@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START California 02/16/01 pt.2 SUBJECT END Our source reports the following regarding today's developments. In sum, due to the governor's sudden panic and resultant willingness to negotiate, all parties are in a wait-and-see mode that makes it unclear whether or not there will be an involuntary bankruptcy filing early next week. Our consensus view is that bankruptcy is still the most likely outcome, but the timing is subject to the ups and downs of these negotiations over the weekend. Creditors, especially the small IPPs are close to the end on forbearance and highly frustrated with the erratic nature of the negotiations.. The events given in this report are chronological:. - The original plan proposed by Governor Davis to the utilities this morning contained the following points:. The parent companies of the utilities would have to return to their subsidiaries $1.5 billion. This money was originally tranferred to the parent companies ostensibly so that the parents could use it to pay taxes. However, as was revealed in the audit, this money was in excess of what was needed for taxes in reality.. The state would purchase the transmission assets for $3.5 billion.. It was proposed that the utilities would issue bonds to pay for the utilities' undercollection. These bonds would be secured against a ""distribution charge"" added to power bills. This money would be collected by DWR and transferred to the utilities, thereby involving the state, but with less than a ""full faith and credit"" commitment.. - In contradiction to preliminary reports that appeared in the press, this plan was rejected by the utilities. One reason for this rejection was the low price on the transmission assets.. - While the bondholders pressed for further negotiations at this point in order to see if a deal could be reached; this is because the bondholders are less impaired than the generators. The generators, however, demanded that they be paid the money they are owed and threatened to move quickly toward an involuntary bankrtupcy filing.. - Local sources report that Governor Davis ""panicked"" at this point. He then offered to purchase the transmission assets for $6 billion (almost twice the earlier offer) and pay the generators' undercollection (which amounts to $9 to $12 billion). Reportedly, the suggested term of the bonds that would be used to pay for this bail-out was 15 years, which would nearly double the actual cost of the bail-out. This plan would be put forward as a emergency legislative bill.. - At this point, consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield entered into negotiations with the state treasurer's office. Rosenfield threatened that if the governor managed to pass this plan, he would start a referendum to counter it. Rosenfield would have up to 90 days after the emergency bill was passed to put his referendum in place. Knowledgeable sources advise that it would be ""very difficult"" for the bonds in the plan to be issued in less than 90 days; therefore, Rosenfield poses a credible threat.. - In subsequent negotiations, Governor Davis has offered to purchase the transmission assets for a price of at least $6 billion, but possibly as high as $12 billion.. - Senator President Pro Tem John Burton is 'very upset' with the governor for giving in on his negotiations so easily.. - Mike Florio, another consumer advocate, contacted Gov. Davis and said that the idea of negotiating a bail-out, as it appeared Davis intended to do, was ""ridiculous."" Florio and the other consumer advocates threatened to ally themselves with Rosenfield and support the referendum if Davis pursued such a course of action. The consumer advocates strongly feel that the generators have to ""take a hair cut"" as part of the solution, as well.. - The governor will announce later this afternoon a ""framework"" solution identical to that we have reported previously - a state purchase of transmission assets and an issuance of bonds by the utilities, but with state support through the DWR. However, the state government has yet to reach consensus on the numbers in this framework, and it remains unclear whether the framework will be acceptable to all parties.. - With this announcement, the bondholders may refrain from an involuntary filing in order to see what the terms of the final agreement will be. The generators, while more inclined to file themselves, may feel that they have put enough pressure on the governor that it may be worthwhile to wait and see, as well. They are interested not only in the terms of the agreement (and particularly the amount paid for the undercollect), but also in the terms of the long-term power contracts that the state must negotiate. For example, if the state is willing to purchase power at high prices in order to placate the generators, they would be very likely to go along with the plan.. -"

The tables above look best when viewed in a fixed-width font,. such as ""Courier."". =. U.S. TRADING SUMMARY. Choppy trading has been the main characteristic of this. morning's action in U.S. equities. After all the selling. pressure over the past few sessions, a bounce in the major. averages was due and started early this morning. Indeed, the. bourses reversed course in premarket trading and headed higher. using a positive earnings report from PeopleSoft as fuel for the. bulls. After dropping lower shortly after the open, equities. made a break for the upside, led by the NASDAQ. However,. concerns over upcoming earnings reports may keep some residual. selling pressure on the bulls. Computer software, telephone and. communications equipment shares are the largest beneficiaries of. the morning's gains. Meanwhile, financials, banks and tobacco. stocks are under pressure.. -. JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY. European markets reversed course, eroding earlier gains as. German communications and engineering giant Siemens slipped into. the red after reporting earnings. The company reported a. third-quarter loss and stated that its semiconductor. manufacturing division would cut jobs. A strong sell off in. French telecom firm Alcatel before its earnings release tomorrow. also cast a pall over the markets. Indeed, the French CAC-40. dropped 0.8%, the German Dax fell 0.7% and the London FTSE. slipped 0.8% by midafternoon. Elsewhere, Tokyo finished. stronger, though it gave up early gains in the afternoon session. as pension funds took profits after the Nikkei-225 was unable to. maintain strength above the key 12,000 level. The benchmark. average closed the session essentially flat while the broader. Topix finished with a 0.8% gain. The rise in the Topix reflects. gains in some of the index's largest capitalization stocks such. as NTT DoCoMo, Sony, Toyota and major banks.. -. CURRENCY SUMMARY. The dollar is performing poorly this morning, thanks to anxiety. over the U.S. recovery story via the endless drumbeat of gloomy. corporate earnings and rumored German demand for euros. The. greenback has slipped to about the 0.879 dollar per euro level. from 0.872 overnight and to around 123.6 yen from 124.4 yen. overnight.. -. MAJOR COMPANY / INDUSTRY NEWS. (All prices as of 11:05 a.m. EDT). ** Semiconductor equipment manufacturer Lam Research (LRCX:. 24.74, + 0.38) reported fiscal fourth-quarter profits that were. much lower than last year's levels, but still managed to beat. Wall Street analysts' expectations. The company stated that it. made $36.9 million or $0.28 per share, excluding one-time losses. and gains, versus a profit of $0.45 per share in the same. quarter last year. Analysts had pegged the company to earn $0.14. per share on average.. ** PeopleSoft (PSFT: 36.63, + 2.39) reported fiscal. second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations and. stated that their next quarter would beat estimates by $0.01 as. well. The company announced earning $47 million, or $0.15 per. share, versus $16 million, or $0.06 per share in the year-ago. quarter. First Call estimates had PeopleSoft earning $0.12 per. share in the latest quarter. Sales rose a. better-than-anticipated 27% to $533 million.. ** AT&T (T: 20.02, + 0.56) and AOL Time Warner (AOL: 42.53, -. 0.17) are in the beginning stages of negotiations about a deal. to merge both companies' cable operations, reported The Wall. Street Journal. Indeed, the talks began just after Comcast. (CMCSK: 35.55, + 0.46) made an unsolicited bid for AT&T's cable. business last week, which is known as AT&T Broadband. The. Journal suggested that one plan called for AT&T to spin off its. broadband division and to simultaneously merge it with AOL's. cable arm. Undoubtedly, there is more to come on this story from. all players involved.. ** QLogic (QLGC: 33.76, - 6.98) reported earnings that were in. line with estimates, but the stock was hammered in early trading. as the firm said sales and profits in its fiscal second quarter. will be lower than expected. The company stated that it earned,. on a pro forma basis, $0.23 per share in its fiscal first. quarter. Sales rose 19% to $92.1 million versus $77.4 million a. year ago.. -. ECONOMIC NEWS. ** Existing home sales in June stood at a 5.33 million unit. pace, lower than the previous 5.37 million unit pace and greater. than the S&P MMS consensus estimate of a 5.30 million unit pace.. ** THURSDAY - Second-quarter employment cost index, June durable. goods orders, weekly initial jobless claims.. ** FRIDAY - Advance second-quarter Gross Domestic Product, June. new home sales, July consumer sentiment.. #.

The Energy Regulatory Commission of Mexico (CRE) recently published a document. that describes possible measures and concrete proposals to update the. regulatory framework of Mexico's natural gas industry. Two key proposals are. the inclusion of US pipeline transportation costs for imported gas in the. domestic pricing formula and changing the current benchmark index use to. calculate the price of Mexico's domestic gas to the Houston Ship Channel (HSC).. The potential benefits to be derived from these changes include. * increased interest in the construction of cross-border pipelines and a. physical bypass of the Pemex pipeline system. * increased trading liquidity and price transparency at the trading point. index to be used in creating Mexico's natural gas sales price. **end**.

240704	1	"SENDER START kevin.garland@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Assessment of Global Crossing SUBJECT END Greg,. As you asked, I have taken a quick look at Global Crossing. I think it is a close call, but they certainly have a decent shot of making it (by ""making it"" I mean the equity will have value and the company will not be restructured through bankruptcy). Their assets, customers, and cash might marginally outweigh the debt load that the company has.. Most importantly, they definitely have a currency (Global Crossing stock) that has more value than anything in EBS. If there is a potential deal to contribute assets of EBS into Global Crossing in exchange for equity, then I would recommend pursuing it even if it means contributing up to $100 million in cash to get it done. However, I would make sure that Enron has no more contingent liabilities, consolidated burn or cash commitments. The real question is will Global Crossing want what we have at any price. I suspect that once they perform due diligence, they will ""run away"" (just as the knights did when faced with the killer rabbit in Monte Python's Search for the Holy Grail).. Thanks,. KG"

We have more degrees. but less sense, more knowledge, but less judgment, more experts, yet more. problems, more medicine, but less wellness.. We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too little,. drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too tired, read. too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We have multiplied our. possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too much, love too seldom,. and hate too often. We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.. We've added years to life not life to years.. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the. street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner. space. We've done larger things, but not better things.. We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but we. communicate less and less.. These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and small. character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are the days of. two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken homes. These are. days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill..

A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to. just hit delete.. Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not going. to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up. to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up and leave your. side.. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that. is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a cent.. Remember, to say, ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved ones, but. most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from. deep inside of you.. Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for. some day that person will not be there again. Give time to love, give time. to speak and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind."

However, I would ask that we eliminate the word ""volumetric"" as. that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world. I.e., if we were truly. to have ""volumetric"" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate. schedule! I just don't want to use this word. I don't think it's necessary. in order to convey Larry's meaning. Why don't we insert: ""on a daily basis. only to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized"".. If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to. If he comes up with any more. issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.. Lorraine Lindberg. 07/07/2000 09:49 AM"

42380	1	SENDER START bukhvalo@haas.berkeley.edu SENDER END SUBJECT START Math Primer and Introduction SUBJECT END Announcement for E283-1: Real Estate Finance:. Dear all:. Let me introduce myself. I am your TA, Barbara Bukhvalova. During this semester you will not see much of me unless you come to my office hours. However, you will be able to read my comments on some of your graded work and will receive occasional messages from me through Izio.. I have TAed this corse before and unlike last semester I am very proud that I have conquered the skill of using finance calculators which is a very hard task for absent minded PhD students. I hold regular office hours which hopefully will fit most, but if for some reason you need alternative arrangements do not hesitate to ask me for an appointment or/and please do communicate with me via email about shorter questions you might have.. I am going to post a math primer momentarily. This document is for (very) optional perusal. It is targeting those of you who had a long break in studies before joining Haas and/or generally are not very friendly with math. The criterion of usefulness of that file is how well you follow the lecture on mortgage math (duration, convexity etc.). If you feel like you are lacking some basic intuition on where the formulas are coming from, you can have a glance at this short (barely 3-page) document. Otherwise you might not benefit from looking at it at all.. I am looking forward to the rest of the semester and wish you all good luck.. Barbara. =. This message was sent from the Izio system at http://haas.Izio.convene.com.. If you have any questions or comments regarding this email or the Izio system, please forward them to IzioSupport@convene.com.

SUBJECT END During one of the World Hunger calls a couple weeks ago I noted that the. later half of Performance Liquidated Damage refund provision in Section. 10.9.8 was slighty broken. I volunteered to find what I thought it should. look like. In reviewing the Arcos contract I found the corresponding. provision that seems to capture what I was concerned about. I have included. the ARCOS provision below for everyone's review. Some of the defined terms. do not match, but...... 14.18.2.2 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed before the. Power Island achieves Acceptance and:. (i) such corrections are made and are complete prior to commercial operation. of the Station, and. (ii) such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall. then Purchaser shall:. (a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages. associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or. (b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall; however, such. reduction in offset or amount of refund shall not exceed the amount actually. offset (payment withheld) in accordance with Clause 30.8 or paid in. accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall.. 14.18.2.3 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed after the. Power Island achieves Acceptance, and such corrections are completed within. one hundred eighty (180) days after the Power Island achieved Acceptance, and. such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall, then. Purchaser shall:. (a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages. associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or. (b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall;. however, such refund of Performance Liquidated Damages or reduction of offset. will not exceed the amount actually offset in accordance with Clause 30.8 or. paid in accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall and the amount of. such refund or reduction of offset shall itself be reduced by the following. amounts for each day that passes from date of the Performance Test on which. the Performance Liquidated Damages were originally based upon until the date. that Seller demonstrated the improved performance:. At a rate of $0.23/day for each kW that the Net Electrical Output. Shortfall of the Power Island is reduced (the ""Output Liquidated Damages. Refund Reduction"").. (d) At a rate of $45.00/day for each kj/kWh that the Net Heat Rate Shortfall. of the Power Island is reduced (the ""Heat Rate Liquidated Damages Refund. Reduction"").. 14.18.2.4 No refund of Performance Liquidated Damages shall be made if the. corrections are made after one hundred eighty (180) days after Acceptance of. the Power Island, unless Purchaser elects to do so as a result of the. corrective action plan presented by Seller prior to the expiry of such one. hundred eighty (180) day period. In the event Seller determines the cause of. a portion or all of the Shortfall prior to the expiry of the one hundred. eighty (180) day period following Acceptance, but in spite of its reasonable. efforts is not able to effect the necessary corrections to the Plant, Seller. may present a correction plan that extends beyond such one hundred and eighty. (180) day period. Purchaser, at its sole discretion, may elect to permit. Seller the opportunity to make such corrections."

I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail. The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.

233488	2	SENDER START h..foster@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Citizens Gas Deal SUBJECT END It looks like we are done on the new Citizens deal effective July 1. I have sent original contracts for execution. We now have to put the deal in the system. This is a little complicated.. The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example. The only differences between June and future months are:. 1) In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu). 2) In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.. Some of the complicated booking issues are:. 1. We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA. 2. We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA. 3. We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal. 1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals. Number 3 is more difficult. The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.. Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked? Let me know if you have questions. I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others. I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.. Thanks!. Chris

There are two worksheets labelled as follows:. 'Total Reqs': Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each. of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".. The. Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed. at. a specific point. The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until. further notice. CES schedulers note: the attached file is archived on. P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a. duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.. 'Daily Change' : shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume. needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the. supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date. For. the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using. the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current. gas. day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for. 3/28. Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was. in. fact effectuated). For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the. change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the. First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the. first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown. (e.g., If. today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect. to. the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional. purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.) This sheet. should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that. we. take or turn back. The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'. shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at. pre-specified prices. Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or. for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be. negotiated.. Doug Kinney. Ph: 703-561-6339.

It seems to me that a crucial next step is to receive tentative approval for injection of BTUs into PG&E, Mojave and SoCal gas pipelines. This site is ideal in terms of the required investment needed to implement the strategy. Additionally, our commercial relationship with Paramount could expedite the necessary agreements. When is our next status meeting ? Kevin, any word from Enron about the long term spread between Henry Hub and Cal border ? Does Enron have a preferred consultant that can give us a long term look ?.

This is summarizing the tour of the Mohave facility on that Larry Garrett and I attended yesterday.. The facility has the track, and room to off-load up to 90 rail cars at one time if necessary. There are three tracks running in parallel, with each track holding 30 cars each. Currently none of the track is being used. With this capacity, the need for storage will be minimal if any, but there is more than enough room to build storage if necessary.. As Bob stated, on this property there is two PG&E gas lines, Mohave gas line, the 30"" El Paso Natural gas line also passes through the site. The High pressure Socal gas line does not appear to pass through the property but must be in the area somewhere, as the plant purchases gas to operate there heaters from Socal.. If any or all the company's who have lines in the area, PG&E, Mohave, El Paso, Socal, are interested in this project, this site is ideal. Paramount Refining is very receptive as the rail rack is currently not in service.. Who knows how much gas flows through this area? To give you some idea, this site is located on the 15 highway just south of the town Mohave. The ROW for the El Paso gas line (All American) passes through the site and crosses the 15 headed West..

Please give me the most convenient date for this tour and I'll set it up.. For your information: on their property PG&E has two 34"" gas lines and Mojave has a 42"" gas line.

Chicago, IL 60640. dan41867@attbi.com. To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. Daniel Lunney

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!. . . The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru."". . . . Inside. . . &#0149; Plan for the Playoffs. &#0149; Game-by-Game Analysis. &#0149; Gridiron Guru. &#0149; Tip of the Week. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Plan for the Playoffs. . . The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are. on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin. with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks,. with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.). If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule,. Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds. they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not. determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding. the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your. regular season.. If your team is still in contention, go to. NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes. during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be. available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff. matchup.. . . . . . . . . . . Game-by-Game Analysis. . . Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did. in each game this season. The player's statistics in the. common categories will be displayed for each game. If you. are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to. see who's been getting the most consistent production.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Gridiron Guru. . . Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!. . . . . . . . Question - Mike Blake. . . I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot.. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin. Muhammad in week ten?. . . Answer - GG. . . Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston. has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing. playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from. a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last. weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success. against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with. Muhammad.. . . . . . . . . Question - Russell Brown. . . My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one. of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,. Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.. . . Answer - GG. . . Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this. season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie. struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and. won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest. playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the. return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in. his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.. . . . . . . . . Question - Chris Gilcrest. . . Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich. Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would. you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,. Curtis Martin?. . . Answer - GG. . . Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but. he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like. Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar. performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a. solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike. Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the. matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three. games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his. struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit. is too good to ignore.. . . . . . . . . . Tip of the Week. . . Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay. healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his. solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to. another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best. Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an. unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.. . . . . . . eDIETS. .

Morrilton, AR 72110-0092. swillbanks@communityserviceinc.com. To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. Steve Willbanks
190849	0	"SENDER START mmolland@brobeck.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Discussion of document retention policy for EES SUBJECT END Bob Williams, Andrew Edison, Michael Molland, Amanda Smith, and two. IT professionals working with EES, Jon Eastlund and Pete van de Gohn, today. discussed a going forward document retention policy for EES as a result of. the California AG's subpoena. This is a summary of our discussion.. * Agreement with AG with respect to EPMI-Portland: I (per my. conversation with Gary Fergus) confirmed that the document retention policy. that was negotiated in December, 2000 with the AG with respect to EPMI in. Portland is as follows: All employees are instructed not to delete any. e-mail for 24 hours. Each 24 hours a backup ""snapshot"" of the entire e-mail. server in Portland is taken. After 24 hours, employees may delete e-mail.. This policy has been in place since mid-December and back-up tapes should. exist for e-mail for each day from mid-December through the present.. * Description of E-mail server organization within EES: All EES. employees are on one of two e-mail systems: (1) the exchange server/Legacy. system or (2) Lotus Notes. The exchange/Legacy system is run off of three. servers located in San Ramon, California, Costa Mesa, California, and. Phoenix, Arizona. The Lotus Notes server is in Houston. The majority of. EES personnel in California probably are on the exchange/Legacy server, but. there is no way of knowing who is which server without individually. checking. EES personnel who were originally hired in California probably. use the Legacy system. Generally, the only in-California personnel who use. the Lotus Notes system are those who were originally hired by EES to work. outside of California. Virtually all EES employees outside California use. the Lotus Notes system.. * Current e-mail retention of Legacy system: The customary practice is. to keep daily back up tapes, which are over written weekly, as well as one. weekly snapshot of the system, which is overwritten after 30 days. As of. last week, the exchange/Legacy server is being preserved as follows: the. daily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are being. preserved by Jon Eastlund. (Jon is checking with his subordinate in Costa. Mesa to confirm that this is also being done in Costa Mesa). Jon reports. that the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates from. May 25th. He is keeping that tape in San Ramon until it can be picked up by. Brobeck.. * Retention of e-mail of Lotus Notes System: The Lotus Notes server is. backed up every day, but the back tapes are erased after seven days and this. policy is continuing. As of several weeks ago (when B. Williams first sent. out notification to Pete Van de Gohn and the IT staff in Houston) the Lotus. Notes server is being preserved as follows: the auto purge and the delete. functions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled for. certain EES personnel(e.g. Sunde and Benevides). In addition, more. recently, the auto purge function was disabled on the computers of. additional personnel (the Golden Bear team) who use the system. As of. today, Pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnel. as well.. * Going forward, we discussed several different policies that EES. might institute. First, we discussed the idea of instituting a policy like. that in place at EPMI in Portland (i.e. preserving the daily back up tapes. that are already being made- but overwritten after a week or so-in the. ordinary course of business). This policy will create a significant amount. of information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it is. requested. However, it is apparently consistent with the policy in place at. EPMI- Portland and is possible to do on both e-mail systems. Second, as an. alternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the delete. function on the computers of key personnel. This is now being done for the. Lotus Notes system. However we understand that the exchange/Legacy system. may not have an auto purge function. Jon will check whether the delete. disabling function can be accomplished on the exchange/Legacy system and. report back. This second alternative preserves e-mail that will be. relatively easy to search for production. However, it may be difficult to. implement for California personal on the legacy e-mail system. Third, we. discussed instructing key EES personnel at issue to move all potentially. responsive e-mails into folders on the system which may they be protected,. reproduced and reviewed.This would be the least burdensome potentially. leaves us open to the ""fox is guarding the henhouse"" argument by the AG.. * Data Servers:We discussed data servers briefly. All personnel are on. different servers for their word documents and spread sheets. This system. has no autopurge function. However, the only way that a document can be. deleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the system..

I am currently in the middle of selecting our Japan Banking Relationship and. several questions have come up.. It is important that I understand how your trading settlements will work.. I have spoken to Louise Kitchen about Enron Online and where it fits in with. our banking. Enron Online does not interface with the banking. It. interfaces with a trading system/accounting system? What I need to know is. what system is planned for Enron Japan's accounting for the trading. The. accounting system you use will interface with our Treasury system.. What it boils down to, is the payment format that we will use to make local. Japanese payments may need special programming to meet the needs of the. Japanese - English translation. The accounting system used will need to. interface with our Treasury software to process the settlements, we will need. to interface with the bank.. Please advise.. Thank you,. Pam Perry

44093	1	"SENDER START jeff.dasovich@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START PUC Press Release Announcing Deal with Edison SUBJECT END PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates. The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC. The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include:. ? Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt. The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment. The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month. The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap.. ? Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner. If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004. Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment.. ? Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt. Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers.. ? The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt.. ? The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered. However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs.. ? The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003.. ? There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities.. ? Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually.. ""This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California,"" said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. ""The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers."". This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property. Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal.. --"

Her records show basically no other income ($75/month), so I subtracted $3,000 from your number. The expenses just need to reflect $20,000 more property taxes and the numbers should be right on. $484 less $244 would be $240 of NOI. I spoke to Jim Murnane this afternoon. He feels this property would most likely warrant 7.5% and a 30 year amortization. See the attached spreadsheets.

New at Meridien Research for January 30, 2002. 1. Converting Policyholders into Customers: Insurance Agents Hold the Key. 2. Integrated, Multichannel Service Systems. 3. Risk Integration Services: Should We Order Out?. Registered clients can access research directly.

Latest Findings from Meridien:. 1. Converting Policyholders into Customers: Insurance Agents Hold the Key. (Customer Relationship Management/Corporate Customer Management Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=825. Financial services institutions process sensitive customer data to deliver products and services to customers in a more efficient and effective manner. New technologies have made this data extremely mobile and vulnerable to uses beyond that for which it was initially collected. Regulators may issue stipulations about the data that can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance their demands for privacy with its need for adequate data. Technology can help, but one must understand its limitations. This report defines privacy management and describes how privacy management middleware works.. 2. Integrated, Multichannel Service Systems. (Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=824. Financial service institutions today face a large, oftentimes bewildering, and rapidly evolving array of service constituencies and channels, each with its own service needs and expectations. Many vendors and some progressive institutions are moving to integrate these multichannel service systems to provide a single source of service information for use across different service channels. This early outlook report examines this still developing trend. It reviews the driving factors, identifies the principal service trends, presents a conceptual model for integrated service, explores success factors, and considers adoption patterns.. 3. Risk Integration Services: Should We Order Out?. (Risk Management Client Access). http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=827. Risk projects are complicated and high risk. Most financial services institutions do not have the staff to fulfill all of the required resources through all of a project's phases and will have to hire assistance from outside. There are new ways, however, to combine the resources of business and IT consultants, vendor-provided services, and in-house capacities to significantly reduce total project costs. Once an institution has a framework for evaluating the abilities and appropriateness of professional service providers and their risk services on offer, it can selectively purchase the expertise and experience it lacks. This report provides such a framework for decision-making, breaking the evaluation process down into phases that mirror the process of acquiring and implementing a financial risk management system.. **.

Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's. doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who. can explain what the heck California's doing). Hertzberg then asked that. FERC do ""its part"" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.. Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.. Overall, the ""no price cap"" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be. under considerable pressure to give in to caps).. The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by. 9 republicant governors opposing price caps. Sue will be distributing the. letter.. Best,. Jeff"

Morning Market View(TM). for Wednesday, December 26, 2001. as of 9:30AM EST. Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research. MERRY CHRISTMAS!. U.S. equity index futures are pointing to a slightly lower open. in the post-Christmas session as economic and equity news is. sparse. Wal-Mart (WMT,57,f2&f4) and Echostar Communications. (DISH,27,f1) were among the few U.S. companies in the headlines. this morning while U.S. Treasuries are lower and Japanese. markets rose slightly.. Leading retailer Wal-Mart stated that it anticipates December. same-store sales at the high end of the 4%-6% range, exceeding. its previous forecasts. For the Nov. 23 to Dec. 24 period, the. company said same-store sales were in the mid-to-upper single. digit percentage range.. According to The Wall Street Journal, EchoStar Communications. Chairman Charlie Ergen wants to expand Hughes Electronics. Corp.'s (GMH,15.02,f2) satellite Internet service. If regulators. approve Echostar's proposed acquisition of Hughes, the Journal. reported, Ergen plans to postpone a ""full-scale deployment"" of. the Internet service until 2004, opting to spend $1 billion in. order to design and launch a ""new generation"" of satellites.. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. (PFE,40.77,f2) received a. favorable court ruling related to its antidepressant drug. Zoloft. A federal judge ruled the company is not liable in the. case of a man who committed suicide while on the drug, despite. allegations by the widow that Pfizer failed to disclose possible. side effects.. -. TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY. U.S. Treasury prices were a bit lower across the curve in the. post-Christmas session. The Redbook retail sales index recorded. a 4.5% drop for the three weeks ended Dec. 22, with. year-over-year sales declining 0.6%. Tomorrow, the Labor. department will release initial jobless claims and on Friday the. markets will be watching for consumer confidence figures, as. well as the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, home sales. figures and durable goods orders.. -. WORLD MARKETS. European markets were closed for the holiday. In economic news,. the French Producer Price Index fell 0.6% in November, twice the. estimate, with the year-over-year figure falling a. larger-than-expected 2.3%. On the corporate front, equity. stories were expectedly sparse given the market closure. The. euro is trading slightly lower versus the U.S. dollar.. Asian markets finished marginally higher as the Nikkei 225 index. advanced 0.6%, with finance and construction issues leading the. way. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (MHVYF,2.55) announced it. plans to cut another 5,000 jobs, or 7.6% of its work force, and. said it would not meet its goal of a 170 billion yen ($1.3. billion) profit until 2006, two years behind schedule. The yen. is higher versus the U.S. dollar, bucking a nine-day trend.. -. FUTURES WATCH. In the March Globex futures contract as of 8:53 a.m. EST, the. S&P 500 Index was down 2.5 points (a point below fair value). while the Nasdaq 100 index was 3 points higher (5 points above. fair value). The March DJIA futures contract was down 25 points.

45516	2	"SENDER START jeff.dasovich@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso SUBJECT END Another defeat for Davis. Tough break. Is the judge's proposed decision available?. Best,. Jeff. FERC Judge Urges Dismissal Of Calif Complaint Vs El Paso. WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California .. The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants.. ""While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power,"" Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday.. The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation.. In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's ""standards of conduct"" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates.. ""El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse,"" Wagner concluded.. ""There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding"" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said.. FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint.. The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported.. ""The briefs measured approximately one linear foot,"" he said.. Contracting With Affiliates. At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001.. California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices.. The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent.. The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply.. But while that market share gave El Paso the ""ability to exercise market power,"" Wagner said, ""it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power."". The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said.. From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used.. Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power.. Improper Communications Seen. Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse.. Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers.. Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso ""demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service"" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion.. Wagner determined that the transcript offered a ""prima facie"" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted.. Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates ""were in clear violation"" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules.. El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a ""legal error"" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said.. The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings.. However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court."

A couple things about the limit orders:. 1: When a customer opens up the limit order box, I think the time open. should default to 12 hours. We want the orders open as long as possible.. Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.. Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading. session unless specified otherwise.. 2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.. When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000. increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the. quantity to be 15,000.. 3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system. saying error trade, price not available.. 4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price,. without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a. valuable feature.. Thx,. John

Just the way many. utilities like it.. BY Daniel Fisher and Lynn Cook. 06/11/2001. Forbes. 080. Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.. Our energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient.. Unfortunately, many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way.. The Bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production. That alone won't. solve the nation's power crunch. ""Supply is not the only issue,"" says. Michelle Michot Soss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of. Houston. ""The issue is bottlenecks."". Some of these bottlenecks are political. A lot of them are created by. incumbent utilities that do not welcome competition.. Florida, for example, whose demand for electricity is growing at about 3.7% a. year, is a net importer of energy. It generates around 24% of its power in. aging oil-fired plants that should be replaced with more efficient. combined-cycle generators. These burn natural gas in a turbine and use the. hot exhaust gases to create steam, which spins a second turbine; they spew. out less particulate and consume about a third less energy.. So why doesn't Florida get efficient power plants? First, the state has only. one main gas pipeline, though others are working their way through the. regulatory process. More vexing is a state law, zealously defended by Florida. utilities, that bans outside competitors from building combined-cycle plants. larger than 75 megawatts--enough to juice 75,000 households--on the dubious. theory that they waste water. Duke Energy tried to challenge the law with a. 500-megawatt plant in New Smyrna Beach. FPL Corp. (parent of Florida Power &. Light) fought the plant all the way to the Florida Supreme Court and won.. Florida's screwy power-plant law is just one example of the byzantine. regulations that stymie efforts to make the nation's energy grid more. efficient and prices more competitive. From laws that protect utilities. against more efficient rivals to outdated state regulations that discourage. the construction of transmission lines, these choke points either waste. energy or make it impossible for energy to get where it should go.. A series of state laws in the 1920s laid down the monopolies on grids. They. were codified in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a populist. law that identified bigness with badness in the electricity business: To. avoid federal scrutiny and regulation, most utilities decided not to operate. outside their own state boundaries; rate setting fell to the states. But even. as wholesale electricity markets have been deregulated, utilities can still. bat away outsiders by reserving their own transmission lines for ""native. load."" This allows them to keep an open lane on the energy highway, as it. were, to rush electricity to certain customers when their demand suddenly. spikes.. In such areas as the Southeast, the owner of a transmission line has a pretty. free hand in calculating what its native load is. So Southern Co., which owns. utilities in Georgia and four neighboring states, can determine how much. power to let into its territory.. Southern Co. defends the rule, saying its primary job is ensuring customers. get all the power they need. ""The marketers would like to schedule another. 10,000 megawatts of power to go across our lines tomorrow,"" says William. Newman, a senior vice president. ""It's not going to happen. The system wasn't. designed for it."". Enron disagrees. Utilization of its natural gas pipeline system increased 50%. in the five years after the gas market was deregulated. Steven Kean, head of. government regulations at the Houston-based giant, thinks similar gains are. possible in electricity if companies like Southern are forced to hand over. control of the grid to independent regional boards that will determine how to. allocate power flows and where to build new lines. The utilities ""don't want. to accept the economically pure solution,"" he says. ""Once utilities have been. adequately compensated for their stranded costs, then it's time for them to. shut up, sit in the corner and let the economists and lawyers work out the. details."". Lawyers and economists making decisions for us? That doesn't sound like. deregulation. But there is a case to be made for separating control of power. lines from control of other utility assets. Phillip G. Harris is chief. executive of PJM (it stood for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland), a regional. power line organization. Since this independent system operator was formed in. April 1997 and six local utilities ceded control over transmission lines,. reliability has gone up and prices down, he says. Where Southern Co. will. only add transmission capacity if it has a firm contract in hand, PJM can. order lines to be built. Its member companies are spending $311 million over. the next three years on new lines to increase the flow from power-rich to. energy-poor areas.. Last May temperatures hit the highest levels since 1930 at the same time as. 15,000 megawatts of PJM's 59,000 megawatts were out of service for. maintenance. As the peak load rose to 51,000 megawatts--7,000 more than was. available within PJM--power streamed in over a dozen entry points. Prices. topped out at $432 a megawatt hour. That's about four times what you are. probably paying for residential service, but it stands in contrast to spikes. in the thousands of dollars in California and the Midwest during similar. crises.. Unfortunately, what works inside PJM doesn't transfer to Los Angeles, much. less to Manhattan. Different rules regarding electricity transactions and a. shortage of transmission lines make it difficult to export electricity across. the Hudson River. When Hydro-Quebec tried to build a power line across Long. Island Sound in 1999, Connecticut nixed the idea. Ostensible reason: the. possibility of harm to oyster beds. Real reason: Folks in New Haven asked,. what's in it for us--and didn't see any clear benefit to them. There is,. unfortunately, no mechanism for buying off losers in these deals, such as. property owners near, but not under, the power line. So they hire lawyers and. talk solemnly about oysters.. California's bottleneck is on Path 15, a 500,000-volt transmission line that. links the northern and southern halves of the state. Path 15 can't. accommodate the flows of power needed when the weather is cool in San. Francisco and hot in L.A. But the legal and financial chaos in California,. with the state on the verge of taking over much of the transmission system,. discourages investors from backing an increase in capacity. ""If we put in. good rules on how to operate transmission systems, you would see investment,"". says Lawrence Makovich, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates.. ""The problem is right now there is no such plan."". Enron is trying to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take. charge, so far to little avail. In a case pending before the U.S. Supreme. Court, Enron accuses FERC of abdicating its responsibility to do for. interstate trading of electricity what it did for trading of gas.. But forcing FERC down that path will be difficult. Natural gas producers. needed interstate pipelines to get to big markets in the North, which needed. the gas. But incumbent (and politically connected) electric companies have no. such incentive to stimulate a national market in electricity. ""There's not a. single incentive in the entire U.S. to relieve congestion,"" states Jeanine. Hull, president of Strategic Energy Advisors and a former power-company. lawyer. ""Ask yourself this question: If you had a chance today to retain your. monopoly or compete, which would you choose?"". Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.. US Sen. Feinstein Urges Hearings On FERC 'Improprieties'. 05/25/2001. Dow Jones Energy Service. (Copyright 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.). WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Friday. for Senate hearings to investigate ""possible improprieties"" involving the. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relations with the industry it. regulates.. ""Despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity. and natural gas markets in California and the West, and a finding by FERC. last November of 'unjust and unreasonable' (electricity) rates, the. commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and. stability to the marketplace,"" Feinstein said in a letter to Sen. Joe. Lieberman, D-Conn., seeking hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs. Committee.. Feinstein cited a report in The New York Times Friday in which FERC Chairman. Curt Hebert related a phone conversation with Ken Lay, chairman of Enron. Corp. (ENE). Hebert alleged that Lay offered to bring his influence to bear. with the Bush administration to maintain Hebert as chairman if the regulator. would adopt policy positions favored by Enron.. Hebert is quoted as saying he was ""offended"" by the conversation. Lay. disputed Hebert's account.. The Times article also quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as saying Texas. utility regulator Pat Wood has ""got to be the next chairman of the FERC"" to. address problems in electricity markets. Cheney's remark is slated for. broadcast by the public television program ""Frontline."". ""While Mr. Lay's account (of the conversation) differs, it is clear that the. citizens of the United States, especially the people of California, who are. suffering from FERC's failure to do its job, deserve an investigation and. full public hearing into what happened,"" Feinstein said in the letter to. Lieberman.. ""FERC is a $175 million-a-year agency charged with regulating the energy. industry, and it would be unconscionable if any of the nation's electricity. traders or generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs. or becomes a member of the commission,"" Feinstein wrote.. ""Since FERC has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the. Federal Power Act to restore 'just and reasonable' electricity rates, we need. to ask whether undue influence by the companies that FERC regulates has. resulted in its failure to act,"" the letter said.. Feinstein seeks a broad investigation into FERC, and not just an airing of. the Lay-Hebert exchange, which Feinstein said she sees as an example of ""a. definite problem,"" the senator's spokesman, Howard Gantman, said.. ""There are very close relationships between FERC and the industry it. regulates. Some of those relationships could be improper,"" Gantman said.. Lieberman, who has requested that the General Accounting Office investigate. FERC's response to the California electricity crisis, will become chairman of. the Governmental Affairs Committee when Democrats assume the Senate majority. in about two weeks..

York Mercantile Exchange futures board.. Traders saw storage buying providing the only hint of demand.. Also, several pipelines in Texas, along with El Paso's Tennessee Gas and PG&E. Citygate, held system-wide operational flow orders on the high inventory. resulting from storage. Those orders also sent prices downward, traders said.. Demand remains slight with only hints of sustained hot weather sighted in the. next two weeks,traders said.. With few demand fundamentals in place, traders saw few utilities in the. market.. The Nymex June futures contract settled at $3.973/MMBtu, down 8.1 cents, the. first time the front contract has fallen below $4/MMBtu in nearly 10 months.. Traders pointed to 17,000 option puts at $4/MMBtu supporting the June. contract. Options expired Friday; the June contract expires Tuesday after the. Memorial Day weekend. Traders expect a $3.80-$4/MMBtu range on Tuesday for. expiration.. Also, Enron Online will keep its trading boards open for the holiday.. Prices for the June contract are in the same range as they were a year ago,. when driving heat and competition for gas during May pushed prices upward.. At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, prices were in a. $3.76-$3.90/MMBtu range, down 25 cents-35 cents..

All Rights Reserved.. FOCUS Brazil real to remain pressured due to energy crisis/political concerns. 05/25/2001. AFX News. 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd. SAO PAULO (AFX) - The real is likely to remain under pressure in the. short-to-medium term due to concerns about the impact of the energy shortage. crisis on the economy and ongoing political worries, analysts said.. They said the energy shortage problems are scaring away direct foreign. investment, while political concerns ahead of the presidential elections next. year are expected to come much more to the forefront once the Argentine debt. swap operation is completed at the start of next month.. The real was at 2.3480 against the dollar in afternoon trade, down about 20. pct from the end of last year.. Analysts said the weakness of the real combined with a generally-accepted. slowdown in GDP growth as a result of the energy crisis has complicated the. task of the central bank's monetary policy committee Copom.. The Copom raised its base interbank Selic rate to 16.75 pct from 16.25 pct. earlier this week, in what was regarded by many analysts as a preventive move. against the inflationary impact of the real's depreciation.. In a recent report, Banco Santander Central Hispano SA said it has revised. its forecast for Brazil's 2001 GDP growth to 2.2 pct from 4.1 pct previously. due to the possible impact of the government's energy rationing plan.. BSCH said it is also cutting its 2002 GDP growth estimate to 3.0 pct from 4.5. pct previously.. BSCH also revised its forecast for the real's level against the dollar to. 2.30 by end-2001 from 2.13.. ""Argentina's problems and their effects on the flow of capital to Brazil.... added to energy rationing and stronger perceptions of political risk hinder a. significant appreciation of the real, although we consider a possible gradual. solution to the Argentine crisis,"" BSCH said.. Analysts said central bank intervention yesterday and today in the foreign. currency market in an effort to stem the real's depreciation is clear. evidence of the central bank's concerns about the local unit.. The central bank today sold 2.0 mln dollar linked-bonds maturing on March 14,. 2002 after selling 1.0 mln dollar-linked bonds yesterday.. ""We don't know how far the real will go. Everything points to a situation in. which the dollar will move to the 2.45 level against the real in the short. term and never return to the 2.0 level it was at at the start of the year,"". Brazilian Institute of the Economy (IBRE) director Renier Garcma said.. Direct foreign investment has slowed down this year as a result of the. concerns surrounding Brazil.. The government has already revised its estimate of direct foreign investment. in Brazil this year to 19 bln usd from 24 bln previously. Direct foreign. investment in the four months to April was 6.6 bln usd, about half the levels. posted a year earlier.. Enron Corp recently suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the Brazilian. energy sector, citing regulatory concerns, while the government decided to. postpone indefinitely the privatisation of Cia Energetica earlier this month. due to the energy crisis.. The minimum price for the sale of Cesp Parana was set at 1.7 bln reals, with. a number of foreign companies lined up to bid.. ""Investors are shying away from carrying out operations in the country. The. energy crisis has had a disastrous impact on Brazil's image; the country risk. has risen and companies are opting for saver markets,"" IBRE's Garcma said.. Analysts said the energy crisis has strongly affected the image of President. Fernando Henrique Cardoso and has therefore strengthened the opposition's. position ahead of next year's presidential elections.. They said corruption allegations involving former and current senior. officials in the government and the alleged breach of vote secrecy rules at. the Senate resulting in proceedings for the dismissal of former Senate. chairman Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and senator Jose Roberto Arruda have. complicated the political scenario.. Yesterday, Senator Arruda resigned from the Senate, while a local TV news. channel reported Magalhaes will resign next week and attack Cardoso.. ""The government seems to have lost direction,"" one analyst said.. Earlier this month, Congress rejected a petition presented by the left-wing. Workers Party (PT) to set up a joint Congress-Senate commission to. investigate corruption in the private and public sectors after 20. parliamentarians belonging to parties within the ruling coalition withdrew. their support for the motion.. Opposition deputy Aloizio Mercadante at the time said the PT was preparing. legal action against the government and the deputies who withdrew their. support for the petition, alleging they were offered financial incentives to. do so.. Analysts said fears remain that the opposition will attempt to revive the. corruption commission issue, further complicating the governability of the. country in an already delicate moment.. bl/cdo/lbc/as For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and. www.afxpress.com.

NEW DELHI, May 25 (Reuters) - India's private power producers demanded on. Friday that the federal government intervene in Enron Corp's bitter row with. a local utility and state clearly if it wants the U.S. energy giant to stay. in India or quit.. ""The government needs to decide whether we want Enron or not. In case they. don't want Enron, they should spell out the reasons for it,"" Harry Dhaul,. director-general of the Independent Power Producers' Association of India,. told Reuters.. But Federal Power Secretary A.K. Basu said Enron and the Maharashtra State. Electricity Board (MSEB) had to resolve their differences over the $2.9. billion project themselves.. ""Basically the Maharashtra government and Dabhol have to sort it out,"" Basu. told reporters after a meeting with Wade Cline, the chief executive officer. of Enron India.. Basu stuck to the federal government's stand that it would help implement any. proposal emerging from negotiations between the Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent. owned by Enron, and the MSEB.. Dhaul said the fate of Dabhol, India's largest direct foreign investment and. biggest power project, would determine the future of domestic and foreign. private investment in power and other infrastructure projects.. ""It is an important issue. It is a benchmark for all future infrastructure. investments of $1 billion plus."". On Thursday, Enron said the MSEB cancelled a disputed power-buying contract. just five days after the Houston-based energy firm moved to pull out of the. project.. WANT PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH. Dhaul said the federal government should intervene in the dispute between. Enron and the utility. ""We want a pro-active approach in supporting. independent power producers."". Basu said the government had advised Enron to thrash out the matter with the. negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra government. The committee is. due to meet on May 29.. Cline refused to answer questions from reporters and only said the company. would not renegotiate the power-buying contract on the basis of a committee. set up by the state government.. ""We won't renegotiate on the basis of the Godbole Committee report,"" he said.. The committee, chaired by a former bureaucrat Madhavrao Godbole, has. suggested that the tariff be re-negotiated to make it cheaper and to remove. the dollar linkage which resulted in a steep increase each time the rupee. fell against the dollar.. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power.. Critics object to it charging 7.1 rupees per kilowatt hour versus 1.5 rupees. charged by other suppliers.. Dabhol Power Co is building India's largest power plant with a total capacity. of 2,184 MW.. The first phase of the $2.9-billion project with a capacity of 740 MW began. operating in May 1999. The second phase that will add 1,444 MW of capacity,. is expected to be completed this year.. Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved..

Portland General Electric reported first-quarter earnings rose. 10 percent as high electricity prices pushed up both sales and. costs for the Oregon power producer, the Oregonian reported.. The company earned $43 million, the paper said. Revenue from. wholesale power sales was $480 million, three times the year-. earlier period, even as costs to buy electricity almost doubled.. PGE's power plants produce less than half the electricity. needed to supply its 728,000 Oregon customers, forcing the company. to buy power on the same markets into which it sells, the paper. said. Dry weather is cutting hydropower resources, and easing. wholesale prices could make it more difficult for the company to. profit from power sales outside the state, the paper said..

Mumbai, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Indian negotiators lack the. authority to solve a dispute that has shut down Enron Corp.'s $3. billion power plant, India's single biggest foreign investment,. said a former member of the negotiating committee.. The negotiators will meet Enron officials on Tuesday next. week, though any proposals made will not be binding on either. Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra. State Electricity Board, the official said. Maharashtra, Dabhol's. sole customer, has refused to pay some of its power bills.. Where is the guarantee Enron and the government will accept. what the committee recommends,'' said R.K. Pachauri, director-. general at the Tata Energy Research Institute, a research. organization. Pachauri said he quit the committee because it was. being asked to renegotiate the project, when it was set up to. solve the payment dispute.. Maharashtra yesterday served Dabhol notice canceling the. power purchase contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board. notice it was set to pull out of the project in six months.. The board has refused to pay Dabhol 3 billion rupees for. power supplied in December and January, saying the bills should. reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty it imposed on the company Jan.. 28 for failing to supply power at full capacity.. Meeting. Other India officials said the two parties can't afford not. to negotiate as there is too much at stake.. Mahrashtra and Dabhol serving each other notices is simply. legal maneuvering,'' said Kirit Parikh, an economist on the prime. minister's economic advisory council.. It won't affect the process of finding a solution because. the ground reality is neither Enron nor Maharashtra can afford. not to find a compromise'' to the dispute, Parikh said.. The government needs a solution as it could be left footing. the bill.. India's federal and state governments, which have guaranteed. the board's payments for power and some of the loans to help fund. the project, may have to pay Dabhol more than 170 billion rupees. ($3.6 billion) if it terminates the 2,184 megawatt power project.. We are going back to Maharashtra tomorrow to work on the. problem.'' Dabhol managing director Wade Cline said. Cline was in. New Delhi to meet A. K. Basu, secretary to the ministry of power."

Dear Mr. Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt..

Politics this week. September 27th 2001From The Economist print edition. . Fight against terror. The United States detained over 350 suspects in relation to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Nearly 400 others are being sought for questioning. None of the detainees has been charged with any crime directly related to the assault.. . See article: Hard evidence would help. . . . George Bush announced measures to stop the financing of terrorism. He ordered the freezing of assets belonging to 12 organisations, 12 individuals and three charities, including those of Osama bin Laden, his al-Qaeda organisation and individuals associated with him. Mr Bush promised action against foreign banks that did not co-operate with anti-terrorist measures and a task-force to combat the problem.. . See article: Getting to them through their money. . . Mr Bush unveiled plans for greater safety in the air including armed marshals on planes and increased security. America's largest pilots' union called for a change in the law to allow pilots to be sworn in as federal agents mandated to carry guns in the cockpit of their aircraft.. . See article: Big government is back. . As American and allied forces prepared to strike against Afghanistan, aid workers in Pakistan readied themselves for an expected 1m refugees.. . See article: What now?. . Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. Since the United Arab Emirates had already severed relations, only Pakistan now has ties with the Taliban. The United States, however, said it was not seeking to overturn the regime.. . See article: The double-act wears thin. . President Vladimir Putin of Russia said he would support the forces of Afghanistan's Northern Alliance in their fight against the Taliban as part of his co-operation with America's battle against terrorism. He also said he might talk to the leader of Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya, which is still fighting for its independence.. . See article: Having second thoughts?. . In response to the terrorist attacks, foreign ministers from Latin America invoked the Rio treaty, a mutual-defence pact dating from the cold war, and pledged to co-operate in the struggle against terrorism. But polls suggested that public opinion in Latin America is cool towards an American military response.. . See article: Together, for now. . Spanish police said they had broken up a cell of people linked to Osama bin Laden. . Ceasefire on demand?. Under intense American pressure, and despite reduced but continuing violence, Ariel Sharon dropped his opposition to a meeting between his foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and Yasser Arafat. The two met at Gaza airport and agreed to try to extend the fragile Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire, and to meet again.. . See article: The beginning of the end of the Palestinian uprising?. . . President Robert Mugabe's ruling party won a by-election in Zimbabwe. There was pressure on the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule soon, for the second time, on the legality of farm seizures. . Frederick Chiluba, Zambia's president, lost one of his closest allies when Michael Sata left the government and his job as national secretary of the ruling party. He claimed that Mr Chiluba's choice of candidate for the presidential election that must be held this year was illegal. . Poland turns left. In Poland's general election, the ex-communist Democratic Left Alliance won easily, with 41% of the vote. The outgoing centre-right government, based on the Solidarity trade-union movement, took only 6% of the vote&#8212;and no seats in parliament at all.. . See article: The left is back--in the centre. . . Speculation mounted that Germany's Greens, many of whom oppose American plans for military action against terrorists, might withdraw from their country's ruling coalition, forcing the Social Democrats to seek new partners or govern in a minority.. . See article: Rocking the government. . . NATO troops in Macedonia completed their collection of weapons handed in by ethnic-Albanian rebels as part of a peace plan. The country's parliament approved constitutional amendments to give ethnic Albanians a better deal. But its government wrangled over how big NATO's follow-up force should be and over how long it should stay.. . See article: Jangling nerves. . Turkey's parliament voted to change the constitution to help bring it closer to EU norms. Among other reforms, restrictions against the use of Kurdish are to be loosened. . A gunman, apparently with a local grudge, killed at least 14 people after storming into a local assembly in Zug, in central Switzerland.. Recruitment drive. Human-rights groups in Sri Lanka appealed to the Tamil Tigers not to recruit child soldiers. The Tigers, who seek a separate state for Tamils in the north-east of the island, are reported to have asked every household in the region to provide one new recruit.. In Macau's first election since the former Portuguese colony was returned to China in 1999, a pro-democracy group gained two of the ten directly elected seats in the largely appointed legislature. The result was reckoned good for the democrats, who have complained of corruption and vote-buying by other groups. . As part of a campaign to save energy, civil servants in Thailand have been told to remove their jackets at work so that less air conditioning is needed to keep them cool.. A third term for Giuliani?. In New York's postponed mayoral primary, Michael Bloomberg easily won the Republican contest. Two Democrats, Mark Green and Fernando Ferrer, now face a run-off. Popular support for Rudy Giuliani, the term-limited mayor, to remain in the post was strong.. . See article: Don't go, Rudy. . . In another embarrassment for America's intelligence services, the FBI charged a senior Pentagon analyst with spying for Cuba.. . See article: Low Fidelity?. . . . The price of coffee sank to its lowest level in three decades as the Association of Coffee Producing Countries scrapped a failed buffer-stock scheme. Tens of thousands of labourers have been laid off in Latin America this year as coffee prices have fallen below production costs.. . See article: Drowning in cheap coffee. . The trial began of 20 people accused of helping to arrange a bomb attack on a Jewish welfare centre in Buenos Aires which killed more than 80 people in 1994. The bombers themselves have never been caught. Intelligence sources claim that they were from Hizbullah, a Lebanese group.. . See article: Bombed. . . . . . . . . . .

SUBJECT END Business; Financial Desk. Transmission Grid Funds Sapped by Power Crisis Energy: As major changes are. pondered, not enough is being invested in upgrading lines that take. electricity from producers to buyers, study says.. NANCY RIVERA BROOKS. 10/11/2000. Los Angeles Times. Home Edition. Page C-1. Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company. With attention focused on building more power plants and using less energy to. solve the country's electricity problems, the high-voltage transmission grid. has become ""gridlocked in a tangle of infrastructure problems and regulatory. uncertainty,"" according to a study released Tuesday.. The transmission business is at a crossroads: The operation of high-voltage. electricity lines around the country is about to undergo major changes at the. behest of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which will soon accept. electric company proposals on new structures for managing utility. transmission facilities.. But because of the resulting uncertainty--as well as community resistance to. new construction--not enough money is being invested to expand and upgrade. the high-voltage lines that take electricity from producers to consumers.. This lack of investment could hinder the growth of competitive markets,. Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a respected energy consulting firm,. said in a study titled ""High Tension: The Future of Power Transmission in. North America."". California's electricity crisis could be eased, for instance, if the state. could get its hands on electrons from Texas, where there is a surplus, the. Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm said. But the two states belong to regional. transmission grids with little interconnection, a situation that provides. safeguards should huge power failures occur but limits how much one region. can help another.. ""These are the highways for electrons, and we need better roads,"" said Jan. Smutny-Jones, chairman of the California Independent System Operator, which. operates the long-distance transmission for most of the state. ""What we're. talking about here is fundamental infrastructure, and we need to make sure. there is sufficient investment made to move the power around."". Smutny-Jones, who also heads a trade group for power generators, agreed that. the U.S. transmission system faces serious challenges, but he noted that. Cal-ISO has approved $800 million in system upgrades and is looking at more.. Said Larry Makovich, a CERA senior director specializing in the North. American power industry: ""Electric transmission and its future has become a. central focus and strategic uncertainty for the North American electric power. industry."". The U.S. power grid is a patchwork operating under different rules and was. not designed to send power across regions--""the job it is now being called. upon to do,"" Makovich said. ""This imbalance between system capacity and. supply and demand has contributed to well-publicized problems in California. and other parts of the country."". Federal energy regulators have not specified what these so-called regional. transmission organizations should look like, although FERC has said utilities. should not control the long-distance transmission lines so new competitors. can more easily enter the market.. In California, the long-distance transmission grid owned by publicly traded. utilities, which serves about 75% of the state, is run by Cal-ISO, a. Folsom-based nonprofit corporation set up by the state's 1996 electricity. deregulation law. California's serious electricity problems this year have. whipped up strong criticism of the structure of Cal-ISO and a sister agency,. the California Power Exchange, which runs the state's electricity market.. The California Municipal Utilities Assn. on Thursday advocated replacing. Cal-ISO with a new ratepayer-owned system that would own and operate. electricity transmission lines in the state, including those of the municipal. utilities. Cal-ISO's defenders said the system worked efficiently under. extreme conditions this summer, which saw record wholesale power prices and. threatened blackouts."

150802	3	SENDER START christi.nicolay@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Re: VEPCO PPA SUBJECT END Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:. I haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times. there are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency. power to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would. want the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to. replace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get. this agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).. I would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.. Interconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting. transmission. It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its. network transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant. Enron will have. to purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the. plant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to. supply at an alternate delivery point. Please discuss this with Kevin. Presto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31). Enron cannot use VEPCO's. network transmission to delivery to third parties.. Is this plant in the VEPCO queue yet? Also, FERC has issued some recent. rulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc. While. VEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that. you do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to. transmission constraints. A request for transmission on OASIS is the only. way to ensure deliverability to third parties.. 3.5 Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an. increase. Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other. sources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission. and subject to getting cut. You may want to consider doing this on. best/reasonable efforts basis. (Also, even if you purchase. daily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of. receipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as. non-firm.). 12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that. has not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since. FERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant. changes in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining. transmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this. contract. Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price. covers that circumstance.. Underlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at. most any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case. Therefore, any. current transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will. pay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this. contract. Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.. Tom Chapman. 06/13/2000 06:07 PM

Or details about the next five games, check out the Rockets 5-Game Outlook (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134695&UID=45454538&MID=188637).. ROCKETS ACTIVATE DAN LANGHI. The Houston Rockets have placed guard Tierre Brown on the injured list with plantar fasciitis of the left foot, General Manager Carroll Dawson has announced. In a related move, the Rockets activated forward Dan Langhi from the injured list.. Brown has seen action in one regular season game, recording two points and three assists while making his NBA debut at Denver on Nov. 9. The 6-foot-2, 189-pound rookie averaged 4.0 points and 2.3 assists for Houston in four preseason games. The McNeese State product received All-Southland Conference honors following each of the last two college basketball seasons.. Langhi has been sidelined for Houston's first nine games with a right ankle sprain. The 6-foot-11, 22-0 pound forward averaged 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in five Rockets preseason games. Langhi averaged 2.7 points and 1.2 rebounds as a rookie last year after being named the 2000 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with Vanderbilt the previous season.. WATCH AND WIN ON UPN 20!.

MO' BETTA BUNCH. Houston Rockets forward Maurice Taylor (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134697&UID=45454538&MID=188637) has purchased 40 regular season tickets and will donate all of the seats to local non-profit community groups that serve underprivileged children. Taylor plans to make the Rockets home game seats available to the community groups throughout the remainder of the 2001-2002 NBA season. Appropriately dubbed the ""Mo'Betta Bunch,"" Taylor's charitable endeavor will touch the lives of. more than 1,400 children in the Houston area.. Each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group attending a Rockets home game will receive reserved seating in Compaq Center, designated with a special, brightly colored banner, and an exclusive, red T-shirt sporting Taylor's name and Rockets jersey number. Schedule permitting, Taylor intends to personally welcome each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group to the game prior to tipoff.. ""I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our deserving youth and provide a Rockets game experience,"" said Taylor. ""Having the ability to touch so many young lives and make a positive impact is truly rewarding."". The Rockets Community Services Department will be responsible for selection of groups to participate in ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" and the distribution of tickets and T-shirts.. The goal of Taylor's ticket donation program is to help non-profit groups who are already making a difference in the lives of children, but who lack the finances to provide extra-curricular activities..

Marion did not know who I should request this information from and suggested that I start with EES.. All the other projects have a stipulation in their agreements requiring utilities to undertake testing of their metering equipment to verify the accuracy of such equipment. If testing reveals that the equipment is outside of a specified range, then the utility will calibrate the meter.. I am looking to send a request for evidence or certification of such testing at Green Power.

129896	1	SENDER START razelg@aol.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales SUBJECT END Carey Gersten. 7030 Earl Avenue NW. Seattle, WA 98117. razelg@aol.com. To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. Carey Gersten

81045	1	SENDER START ann.smith@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter) SUBJECT END DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER. I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group. We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR). After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation. Rick Miles will be the mediator.. The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims. Both parties indicated a willingness to settle. Rick Miles will act as a facilitator. Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative. As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve. Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case. Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.. Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting. A neutral location needs to be agreed upon. Once additional information is learned, I will advise. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Updgrades and. Downgrades.. Enjoy!. Joe. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/. Upgrades. QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and. Brooks' fantasy owners must be ecstatic. Brooks has scored multiple. touchdowns in 3 of the last 4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for. the remainder of the season. With an easier schedule and better decision. making, Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson. and breakout tight end Boo Williams.. QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers. He has. thrown for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games. I wouldn't bench. Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now. He is a stud.. QB - Charlie Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves. recognition. However, I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions. give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for. the winless Lions. A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as. Green Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule.. QB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance on Sunday with 311 yards and 4. touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the. AFC. With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic, Gannon will continue. to post good numbers for the remainder of the season.. QB - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3. touchdowns. More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb. injury that has been nagging him throughout the season. As always, keep. Warner in your starting lineup.. QB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing yards and. 4 touchdowns. Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless Lions.. Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks. against San Diego and Oakland. Plummer might be a good option for playoff. weeks as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16.. RB - Shaun Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in. the lineup. He scored his 10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly. cleared 100 yards once again. Look for Alexander to remain the starter once. Watters returns from injury.. RB - Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better. The 133. total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the. second half of the season. Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense. will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games. With Correll. Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will. not lose many carries to Buckhalter.. RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears. defense, but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into. the upgrades section. More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned. to 100% after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.. RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly reached the 100-yard plateau once. again. He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend. for the remainder of the season. The 49ers offense continues to look good. and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of. starting running backs in the league.. RB - Ricky Williams - The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient.. With Brooks making wise decisions, the offense will continue to get better. and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams. Williams has. topped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks. Look for this trend to. continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the. season.. WR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield. and Booker's statistics were directly affected. He burned the Buccaneers. for 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy. Look for. more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season. With. teams starting to ""sell out"" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect on. some play action pass touchdowns.. WR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with. 8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday. With Aaron Brooks making wiser. decisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the. board. Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners, it is good. news for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson.. WR - Jerry Rice - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from. defenses, Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field.. The career touchdown leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it. look rather easy. With the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should. continue to see scoring chances. A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in. your lineup.. WR - Peerless Price - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday,. Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many. fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo. With. Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams, Price has quietly scored 5. touchdowns on the season. Price is a talented receiver and should continue. to score a touchdown every other week.. WR - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has. only scored two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage. numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis. I've never been. a big fan of the Steelers passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for. active duty on a weekly basis.. WR - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week. Fantasy. owners had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns. Look for. Boston to continue to put up quality numbers.. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/. Downgrades. QB - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little. bit heading into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor. performance on Sunday. With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for. the year, Griese's receiving options were limited and his production was. directly affected. You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is. healthy. However, the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving.. QB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and was held to 144 passing. yards against a stingy Ravens defense. Couch should be considered a quality. keeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent. quarterback for the remainder of this season. Couch should do well against. Cincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England, Green Bay and. Pittsburgh.. QB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup. this week. With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week, it may. be best to start someone else this week.. QB - Elvis Grbac - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday.. The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown. passes. The schedule looks favorable for Grbac, but he is struggling, which. concerns me.. QB - Tony Banks - Banks suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against. Denver. The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and. then taken off the field on a stretcher.. QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday.. Unfortunately, Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense.. The up and down season for Fiedler continues. With games against Buffalo,. Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be. considered a quality ""spot starter"".. RB - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday. He. has yet to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season. I guess the. toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most. anticipated. Although we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have. meant the demise of George this season. First, the loss of lead back. Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes. Finally, the Titans offensive. line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons.. RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under 60 yards for the second. consecutive game. With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run,. Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout. the remainder of the season. Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents. (Green Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in. the league. With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the. schedule for the remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and. down.. RB - Lamar Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to. struggle. This marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3. yards/carry. Don't be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger. role in the running game.. RB - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle. He managed just 29 yards. on 13 carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble. A running back can. not be productive with just 13 carries. Keep him on your bench.. WR - Rod Smith - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25. yards on three catches. He did manage to score a touchdown. Smith's ankle. injury deserved your attention. The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines. late in the 4th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the. field and tie the ball game. The short week will not help Smith's status on. Thanksgiving Day.. WR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing season for Moulds continues. He was. held to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained 138 on the other side. of the field. Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills. at this point.. WR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on. Sunday. Testaverde and the passing game isn't looking very good at this. point. You may want to bench Chrebet until he is 100% healthy.. WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list.. Heck, I like the guy and think he could become special. However, he remains. to do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis.. WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable. to play in the second half against San Francisco. Heck, his production was. not missed. It's pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you. know what I mean. If you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean.. WR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status. is not yet known. He has yet to do anything special this season, but his. expectations were fairly high, so I'll downgrade him. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/. Waiver Wire. Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14. team leagues.. QB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on. Sunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns. He has a talented. receiving crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma. As long as he can get pass. protection, his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in. need of a quarterback.. RB - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56. yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense. No other. running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense. Gay. may just be that guy.. RB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the. Browns, Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against. Jacksonville. If you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a. roster spot. If not, you may want to take a flyer on this guy. The. Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the. door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers.. RB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue. If Curtis. Martin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality. numbers. Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot. If you have. Curtis Martin, get Lamont Jordan.. WR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards and a touchdown.. This marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards. With the 49ers. looking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent ""spot. starter"".. WR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the. Redskins. However, he continues to learn the offense and should start. producing very shortly. Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with a. healthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the. field.. TE - ""Boo"" Williams - ""Boo"" has me excited about his potential. He's a big,. fast tight end with good hands. Plain and simple, he has big play potential. and should produce in the Saints offense.. /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/. Bryant Analytics, Inc. All Rights Reserved 1999-2001.

216252	0	"SENDER START walt.serrano@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START FW: A Good Laugh! SUBJECT END THINGS I'VE LEARNED FROM MY CHILDREN...(HONEST AND NO KIDDING). 1. A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2000 sq. foot house. 4inches deep.. 2. If you spray hairspray on dust bunnies and run over them with. rollerblades, they can ignite.. 3. A 3-year-old's voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded restaurant.. 4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong. enough to raise a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a Superman. cape. It is enough, however, if tied to a paint can, to. spread paint on all four walls of a 20 by 20 foot room.. 5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on. When. using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few times before. you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.. 6. The glass in windows (even double pane) does not stop a baseball hit by. a ceiling fan.. 7. When you hear the toilet flush and the words ""Uh-oh,"" it's already too. late.. 8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.. 9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a. 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies.>. 10. Certain Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a. four-year-old.. 11. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.. 12. Super glue is forever.. 13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't. walk on water.. 14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O.. 15. VCR's do not eject PB&J sandwiches even though TV commercials show. they do.. 16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.. 17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.. 18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is. 19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not. like ovens.. 20. The fire department in Austin, TX has a 5-minute response time.. 21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy. 22. It will, however, make cats dizzy.. 23. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.. 24. The mind of a six-year-old is wonderful...True story. One day the. first grade teacher was reading the story of the Three Little Pigs to her class.. She came to the part of the story where the first pig was trying to. accumulate the building materials for his home. She read, ""...And so the. pig went up to the man with the wheelbarrow full of straw and said,. ""Pardon me sir, but may I have some of that straw to. build my house?"" The teacher paused then asked the class, ""And what do. you think that man said?"" One little boy raised his hand and said, ""I think. he said 'Holy Shit! A talking pig!"" The teacher was unable to teach for the. next 10 minutes."

UT's uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them. Here are some o=. f. the responses .... . . . One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their =. . uniforms. I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the classiest=. ,. coolest uniforms in the country! I admit to being biased, but love the. simple, non-busy look of the all-white uniforms. I also have no problem wi=. th. the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested. The white helmets=. . with the simple, yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as pronounced a=. s. the ""star"" on the Dallas Cowboys' helmet. While I agree with him about the=. . black shoes, I think any changes to ""individualize"" or otherwise change. their ""look"" would be a move in the wrong direction. - Rick Peurifoy. . I was interested in John Pharr's comments about the UT uniforms. Having=. been. at UT in the 1960s, I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go. I=. . certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenc=. ed. by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans. individual name on back and ""TEXAS"" on the front), with the plain white pan=. ts. and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but=. . the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the. ""candy-striped"" pants (ala OU) and added the ""TEXAS"" to the jersey.. Personally I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings=. . would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One=. . amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the=. . uniforms; his response was that these are ""work clothes"" and not intended t=. o. be fancy. I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes bac=. k. a long way. I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the=. . Longhorn in the early 1960s, but it didn't add much. Keep up the good work.=. I. always enjoy your newsletter. - Tom Thornell. . Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are amo=. ng. the sharpest anywhere. If we change the helmets, then we look like a high=. . school team. What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are=. . orange and white. Period. So what if it doesn't have too much color? I hope=. . we stay exactly the same. Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms an=. d. added orange pants? They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field.=. -. Russell Phillips. . . . . Longhorn Q & A. Q: Can you give us a look at the bowl picture?. ?? Sandy Martin. . BROWN: Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday a=. nd. will face either Oregon State or Oregon. It will be Oregon State if the. Beavers don't get a BCS berth. It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BC=. S. berth. If OU beats Kansas State, look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton=. . Bowl. Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl; Iowa State would go to the. Insight.com Bowl; Texas A=02?would go to the Independence Bowl in Shrevepor=. t and. play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State; and Texas Tech wou=. ld. go to the galleryfurniture.com Bowl. . ?. . . . . . . . Chris Simms . . Q: I'm very happy for Chris Simms, but what should we expect from him no=. w? It. seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt, although one could argue=. . that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year. Stil=. l,. since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yank=. ed. after five passes, a redshirt seems like a reach. If he doesn't redshirt,=. . what is. . the best guess for Texas QB in 2001? I know that you get asked this ever=. y. week, but with the new development following the A=02?game, it seems that w=. e are. starting fresh in this story.. ?? Kyle Moore. . BROWN: Simms' big-time performance against A=02?adds all kinds of new =. wrinkles. to the landscape for 2001. My best guess is Simms will get the start for th=. e. bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this=. . season. Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again=. . gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into t=. he. spring and next fall. Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a=. . rotation again. But one would have to think after the sluggish start the. offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be. reluctant to do that again. Despite breaking nearly every passing record at=. . Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his las=. t. outings before getting injured. Simms would seem to have everything going h=. is. way. The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlie=. r. this season. Now that they've seen it, you would have to think that they wa=. nt. to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next tw=. o. years (not stick with a guy who only has one season left). I'm not saying=. . that's fair. But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would. think. But we won't know how the QB situation for 2001 will shake out until=. . next fall, most likely.. ?. . . Q: Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning, UT cou=. ld. have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full. Do y=. ou. think B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on?=. . Did they just blossom during the A=02?game? Otherwise, why haven't they see=. n the. field more?. ?? A.B.. . BROWN: Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, bu=. t you. could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year=. . with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will ha=. ve. back at those positions. There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that t=. he. fullback position was pretty average this season. So the coaches will take =. a. strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB. At 6-3 and 235, he has the=. . size. He is also quick with good hands. If Matthews doesn't add significant=. . oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more=. . one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field. But we'll see. UT coaches=. . did a nice job of adjusting this season to a two-back, two-receiver set aft=. er. they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers (with too many=. . formations and too many quarterbacks). Now that the receivers can probably=. . handle more of the playbook, look for UT to be as multiple and complex an=. . offense as possible next season. B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team=. 's. second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty. Sloan Thomas was the o=. ne. who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions=. . and be ready to fill in at any of them. So he was slowed by the learning. process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and. Brandon Healy. Healy is a senior, so he'll be gone next year. Flowers shoul=. d. be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking.. ?. . . Q: Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are=. . either redshirting or transferred?. ?? Bart Fields. . BROWN: Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the=. . sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer=. . Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan). Simms said=. . both will really help the team a lot next year. Jeffery is 6-2 and trying t=. o. bulk up from 170 pounds. Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170. pounds. But both have shown great hands in practice. The first two names th=. at. jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl=. . practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and=. . Rashad Thomas. With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'And=. re. Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new=. . faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at=. . linebacker in two years.. ?. . . Q: I'm a little concerned about our running backs. Next year's crop loo=. ks. mighty inexperienced. We never seemed to be able to run up the middle. consistently this year. Who would you figure has the best shot at being an=. . inside bruiser? What role will our fullbacks play? . ?? Russell Phillips. . BROWN: It's the biggest question mark on an offense that should be. absolutely loaded next season. I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis=. . and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take ov=. er. at tackle nicely. Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Gar=. r. has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good. So with a line=. . that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run=. . behind it. Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges=. . Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility. Coaches want Victor Ike, Ken=. ny. Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up. Coaches have told those=. . three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next=. . year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce. consistently.. ?. . . . . . . . Sloan Thomas . . Q: With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has, is there enough room at wideo=. ut. for Artie Ellis next season?. ?? Frank Seles. . BROWN: Don't be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season.=. At. 6-3 and more than 200 pounds, he is a bit undersized but could add the. weight. His speed would give Texas the sure-handed, deep-threat tight end=. . they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife. It may be a longshot, but don'=. t. be surprised.. . ?. . . Q: While watching the A&M-UT game, I noticed that UT received the ball =. at. the opening kickoff and the second-half kickoff. And UT got the wind at its=. . back in the 4th quarter. How did this happen, and if A=02?won the toss, why=. . would the Aggies choose to defer, give UT the ball at both kickoffs, and go=. . into the wind in the 2nd and 4th quarters?. ?? Ryan M., Austin. . BROWN: Texas A=02?won the toss at the beginning of the game and chose =. the wind. at its back, giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter. The=. . Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter=. . and took the ball into the wind.. ?. . . Q: Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team co=. ach.. UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams. This=. . year the Longhorns would have been 10-1 and possibly on their way to a BCS=. . game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown=. . against Stanford. With money apparently not being a factor, I really do not=. . understand why Brown doesn't break down and hire some specialized help. . ?? Don Stevenson, Huntington, Texas. . BROWN: I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan, which is =. to. divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches.. ?. . . . . . . . De'Andre Lewis making the tackle . . Q: Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is f=. or a. winning team. We've had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer a=. nd. James Brown whose on-field performances may have been surpassed by their. off-field contributions. I think we're losing a lot of leadership this year=. . when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave. Of the returning players, who=. . does it look like will step up as team leaders next year?. ?? Keith Heugatter. . . BROWN: On defense, Mack Brown said he'll look for Cory Redding and De'=. Andre. Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers and=. . Greg Brown. On offense, UT will look to its quarterback, its young receiver=. s. and linemen such as Antwan Kirk-Hughes of Waxahachie for leadership.. ?. . . Q: What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season?. ?? Steve Beauchamp. . BROWN: The obvious ones are Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers, Greg Brown, H=. odges. Mitchell and Leonard Davis. But the one that may be missed the most is Kris=. . Stockton. He kicked several game-winning field goals two years ago and has=. . done nothing but continue to break records since. He has been an afterthoug=. ht. because he has been so automatic on field goals. He has also done an. excellent job of punting this season. Matt McFadden, a redshirt freshman,=. . will handle the kicking duties next year. And at punter, redshirt freshman=. . Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed =. to. the Longhorns for next year. That will be a huge question mark for Texas to=. . answer next season.. ?. . Q: Who do you pick in the Kansas State-OU game? Seems like OU is missin=. g its. October magic. I'd have to take OU in a close one, 28-24. Heupel isn't grea=. t,. but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offens=. e. in the pros.. ?? Andrew Bowen. . BROWN: I, too, think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue=. its. Shock the World season. Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce=. . some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman. The vote=. s. are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum.. ?. . . Q: Can you give us an update on the men's and women's basketball teams?=. . ?? Lucius Thornton. . BROWN: The men's team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victor=. ies. over Navy, California and Indiana - any of which could help the Longhorns=. . down the road at tournament time. The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to=. . Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT, but coach Rick Barnes was able=. . to prove a point to his team about being intimidated. As of Tuesday night's=. . game with UT-San Antonio, Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup =. -. point guard Royal Ivey, small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thoma=. s.. Duncanville's Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward. Chri=. s. Owens has been a shot-blocking force, and transfer Maurice Evans is the. team's leading scorer, and is starting to hit a better percentage from the=. . floor. The men's team doesn't have another test until Dec. 9, when the team=. . plays at South Florida. Other games worth watching or getting tickets for=. . include home games against Illinois (Dec. 23) and Utah (Dec. 30). The women=. 's. team has also gotten off to a nice start, with its only early-season loss=. . coming against Purdue. The women's team is relying on several newcomers,. including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings. The team i=. s. also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard. So both teams are young with=. a. lot of upside.. . . . . If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri=. be,. sign up at: Newsletter Registration. .

Significant New Issuance - Commentary:. ?The emerging markets started the week on an extremely quiet note as inv=. estors awaited more news from Argentina, in particular, on possible IMF sup=. port for the country. The situation started to improve on Tuesday night aft=. er Domingo Cavallo's speech intended to support domestic confidence, in whi=. ch he reiterated that the Argentine government would not default on its deb=. t payments. He also announced some special measures designed to reduce the =. government's debt burden, such as an acceptance of bonds as payment for pas=. t-due taxes and bond coupons for future tax liabilities. This announcement,=. together with positive clues from the IMF about the possibility of a US$6.=. 9bn disbursement to Argentina, helped the market to rally around 2.5 points=. . However, the continued fall of international reserves and private sector =. deposits, evidenced by the latest data release, did not contribute to reviv=. e investor confidence and pulled the market down by around 1 point. In Turk=. ey, the week was fairly busy with prices rising on the back of the successf=. ul T-Bill auction and as a result of a technical short squeeze. Real money =. accounts and local banks were active buyers of Turkish bonds helping the Tu=. rkey 2030 benchmark to break through an important resistance level of 80. R=. ussian market activity picked up on the positive news from Argentina, but t=. he rally was not sustained and Russian bonds closed almost unchanged on the=. week. Central and Eastern European assets had a positive week gaining arou=. nd 0.25-0.50 points in price. Overall, the general sentiment in the emergin=. g debt markets has improved but is still very much subject to stabilisation=. in Argentina.

The bond was priced at a spread of +335 bps over Treasu=. ries. The fact that a Latin American issuer was able to successfully place =. such a large transaction is a good sign that the impact of the Argentine cr=. isis is limited and has not shut down the primary market for borrowers.. ?The Republic of Latvia's (Baa2/BBB) credit rating outlook was raised by=.

Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2001. Coalition for a Powerful Future Launches Awareness Campaign. WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 5, 2001 - With the aim of helping the public stay abreast of recent developments and positive contributions from competition in the electricity industry, a group of major power suppliers and stakeholders today announced the launch of a 13-week information campaign under the banner of the ""Coalition for a Powerful Future."". ""We have come together to educate consumers and policy-makers about the benefits of competition,"" said Lynne H. Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Association, a member of the Coalition for a Powerful Future. ""The research tells us-and experience has shown us-that competition can bring lower average prices and more choices for consumers from an array of value-added services."". The Coalition was established to raise public awareness about significant developments regarding competition in electricity. The ad hoc group today began running TV ads to share new research and specific data on the benefits to consumers of truly competitive electricity markets.. The campaign will initially focus on reaching the Washington, D.C., audiences of such cable news networks as CNN, MSNBC and the FOX News Channel.. One of the studies that will be highlighted in the campaign is a recent survey done by the Boston Pacific Company showing that consumers have been benefiting most in markets where wholesale competition has been the heaviest. In the 15 years following the start of wholesale competition, the study found that the overall cost of electricity went down 36 percent among 60 surveyed utilities.. Another study highlighted in the campaign launched today is a recent report from Pennsylvania's Department of Revenue that found that retail electricity competition there will create more than 40,000 new jobs by 2005. The report also showed that over the same period, competition will add more than $2 billion to the state's economy, with personal income increasing by $1.8 billion.. ""Not only can competition result in reduced rates, it also can bring technological efficiency, environmental improvements, enhanced reliability and increased innovation in pricing and services,"" Church said. ""When done right, competition in the electricity industry has the power to provide thousands of new jobs and to add billions to states' economies and the personal income of state residents."". The coalition will concentrate on education, principally through its ads and today's launch of a new Web site http://www.powerfulfuture.org,which serves as a gateway for visitors to link to helpful studies and informative research on the subject of competition.. The following organizations have joined as founding members of the Coalition for a Powerful Future:. ? AES NewEnergy Inc.. ? Allegheny Energy, Inc.. ? Duke Energy North America. ? Dynegy Inc. ? Electric Power Supply Association. ? Electricity Consumers Resource Council. ? Enron. ? National Energy Marketers Association. ? Reliant Energy. The Coalition is committed to informing the public about the significant benefits that can result from the successful implementation of competition in electricity. It welcomes the participation of all interested stakeholders. For further details, visit the coalition Web site at www.powerfulfuture.org.."
151116	2	SENDER START britt.davis@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START In re Enron Petrochemicals Claim Against Underwriters/In re M/V INDUSTRIAL BRIDGE/ In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGO SUBJECT END Andy,. I am handling three insurance claims that need extensions of time for suit against Underwriters. I would like to send the attached request for extension of time tomorrow or Monday, given that we will start running into vacation schedules otherwise. There are agreed extensions of time in place for the first two matters already, and they expire December 31. Sharron West, the Underwriters' adjuster on all three claims (I believe that the policy is the same in each case), has asked that we submit all requests for extensions of time at once.. The only somewhat problematic matter is Enron Petrochemicals, in which we have submitted a fully documented claim some time ago. Subject to what Jim Studdert thinks, I thought Underwriters would have paid us by now. By getting an extension of time, we may be giving Underwriters the message that they have more time to delay. We had to file a third-party action against Baytank in order to prevent Underwriters' subrogation rights from being prejudiced. I do not want to incur costs prosecuting a third-party case that I don't have much faith in. Remember than an extension of time does not preclude us from filing suit earlier. If we don't get paid by year end or shortly thereafter, we can always choose to file suit then.. I invite everyone's comments.. Britt. --

Yesterday, we received a call from the AMEE ( Mexican Association of Electric Power), where Ricardo is the Vice-president of de-regulation and open access, regarding to the six-month?s payment to the AMEE. This payment is for $900 dollars or $9000 pesos. I just wanted to ask you if we should continue or not our relationship with the AMEE. Last Friday we were invited by the AMME to a working breakfast with Senator Genaro Borrego, where he explained to us his proposal related to the energy sector reform.. Below you will find a brief description of the AMEE.. The AMEE was created on February of 1999, after President Ernesto Zedillo sent an initiative to Congress for the restructuring of the Electric Industry. From that moment the intention of the AMEE has been to actively participate in the discussions and of course in the opening of the electric market for the private investment.. This association allows the participation of all of the members of the industry that have interest in promoting the AMEE?s ideas and are willing to contribute with their ideas to the opening of the energy industry. The AMEE is an organism that has had access to privilege information for its analyses from the government authorities and the Congress. In fact, the AMEE is negotiating the best conditions for the opening and de-regulation of the market with them. The AMEE has work teams with the CFE, the CRE (regulatory entity), Pemex, the Secretariat of Energy and with the National Commission for energy savings.. The AMEE has organized working breakfasts with members of the Congress, and co-organizing events like the Power-Mex 2001, co-generation seminars and specialized conferences related to the energy area, etc..

20020	1	SENDER START algoreply@algorithmics.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Algorithmics: Energy Risk Solutions SUBJECT END Dear Colleague,. Recent market events demonstrate how important it is for market participants to enact an effective and efficient assessment of counterparty credit risk. Over the past calendar year we have seen unprecedented deterioration of credit quality from some of the world's largest energy firms. As a result, many market participants have suffered significant credit losses, which have directly impacted their profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, it often took weeks or months for many of the affected firms to know the total amount of their exposure to these troubled energy companies.. Over the past five years Algorithmics has been working with energy companies to solve these problems. Algo Energy enables firms to quickly analyze the risk of their portfolios and find answers to key questions. Specifically:. What is the value of the transactions I have with the counterparty and what is my potential loss in case of default?. How many affiliated entities are we trading with and what is the overall exposure?. How are the agreements in place going to offset the transaction exposures and reduce this potential loss?. What is the state of all posted collateral and guarantees and how does it mitigate my potential losses?. What is my exposure to other counterparties that share similar characteristics or are exposed to the same troubled counterparty?. How will these exposures change if market conditions change?. Today, some companies are answering these questions proactively and allocating capital appropriately. They know the risks they are taking and they are managing their exposures to leveraged counterparties carefully. In the event of market downturn, they reduce their exposures before credit deterioration happens. Many of these companies are able to do so as a result of Algo Energy, Algorithmics' comprehensive risk management solution for energy markets.. Algo Energy helps a firm manage the complex interaction between market, credit, and liquidity risk. At the core of Algo Energy is a sophisticated risk engine that applies market leading valuation methodologies to all the physical and financial deals booked against a firm's counterparties, across all energy markets and using all plausible scenarios. This methodology allows a firm to establish how counterparty exposures will evolve over time and over scenarios and assess how market factors effect the credit quality of counterparties. Only through a scenario- based methodology can these interactions be computed efficiently and accurately at the enterprise level.. Further, by applying netting agreements imbedded in complex counterparty structures, Algo Energy allows a firm to monitor and manage actual and potential exposures against counterparty limits structures, while taking into account the proper valuation of collateral and roll-off risk. Algo Energy, allows a firm to manage the various states of collateral agreements. By monitoring the agreement's threshold schedule (among other factors), the system identifies changes in obligations of the firm's counterparty due to changes in the firm's credit rating. The system in turn directs real-time states of agreements to assigned relationship managers or operation managers for active collateral management.. Building on the award winning Mark-to-Future technology, Algo Energy helps a firm to manage their risk pro-actively. It provides transparency, flexibility and scalability at the enterprise level. This state-of-the-art technology is delivered in a distributed framework for the enterprise. Computed once, the same exposure calculations can be analyzed at either the desk level or the enterprise risk level, ensuring consistency in reporting and data quality. The distributed framework also ensures that the system is scalable and flexible to support the growing needs of the enterprise.. Algorithmics is a world leader in enterprise risk management solutions. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, with 15 offices and over 500 employees worldwide, Algorithmics has the largest number of dedicated risk management professionals under one roof. The Algorithmics energy risk team, located in our New York City and Toronto offices, would be happy to provide further information about our energy risk products and services. To reach us, call 212-625-5260 (New York) or +1 416-217-1500 (Toronto), to speak to one of our energy risk professionals. Alternatively, you can email us at info@algorithmics.com ..

26763	1	SENDER START ayesha.kanji@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START FOEX and September PPPC Flash Report SUBJECT END Hello Team,. The FOEX US pix paper index for newsprint is down $6.22 from $530.87 last week to $524.65 this week. The decline continues.... PPPC released its September Flash report for newsprint. Please find the Flash report notes below and the September numbers attached in the file below:. Production at North American mills was 15.6% lower than in September of last year, resulting in an 82% operating rate. If we exclude the 130,000 tonnes of idled capacity at the Steilacoom WA mill, the North American operating rate would be 83%.. Total North American newsprint shipments were down 15.4% year-over-year in September, largely the result of North American demand falling off by 15%. This drop in demand can be explained in part by consumers reducing their stock levels in September 2001. This explains why consumption figures registered a lower year-over-year decrease for the current month.. Shipments to overseas markets also suffered a decline, dropping almost 17% compared to the same month last year, as North American deliveries to Western Europe fell 41%.. At the end of September, North American mills saw their inventories decrease by 28,000 tonnes from the preceding month to 477,000 tonnes, and therefore back below their historical average.. US dailies consumed 9.1% less newsprint than in September 2000, and total consumption in the US was down 9%. Many publishers reported a substantial increase in newsprint usage to cover the September 11th tragedy (additional sections, increased single-copy sales), especially in the week that immediately followed it. However, the increase in consumption seems in effect to have been offset by the wave of advertising cancellations in the aftermath of the attack. At the end of the month, US dailies stock levels were 84,000 tonnes lower than the preceding month. Thus US dailies stocks fell from 43 days of supply at the end of August to 38 days of supply at the end September.. Ayesha

37713	3	"SENDER START alan.comnes@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Update on Charts Characterizing the Cost to Build a Peaker Plant in California SUBJECT END Steve, Dan W. et al:. (Dan, can you make sure these charts get to Steve?). Attached are some updated charts that are more accurate with respect to. Enron's current estimated cost of peakers in California. Costs are up and,. to the extent you use these types of charts, you should use these updated. ones. If you do not, this information will get attached somehow to our. November 22 comments.. In general, the higher the cost to build, the worse a price cap looks in. terms of disincentives to pursue a project.. Background on the Change:. Our origination people (Chris Calger) inform us that building a peaker. plant in California is now more expensive than Enron estimated back in. August. These ""August"" numbers were circulated in a presentation by Tim. Belden and were filed with the FERC.. The peaker charts to reflect a 25% increase in capital costs. An increase. in costs is due to things such as:. longer development time (Cal ISO has dragged out the schedule). local permitting constraints (sound abatement, strict construction schedules). labor costs in California. emission offset credit costs are higher than previously expected. These higher costs, along with the uncertainty created by price caps, has. caused Enron to stop pursuing certain peaker, including Pleasanton. Although. price caps increases uncertainty and increases the cost of capital, I have. not updated the charts to reflect a higher cost of capital as a conservatism.. Alan Comnes"

If you have definitely been tasked with producing an EU Institute paper for the Barcelona EU Heads of State economic summit next Spring, to support progression of the liberalisation acceleration legislation, then I can give you plenty of ideas about justification and the practical differences it could make. We can have a preliminary talk by phone. After that I reckon it would be worth my collecting together some written material for you and then meeting. I assume that private funding is not required in this instance.. I am leaving Washington this afternoon, and should be back in circulation in Brussels later this week. Kind regards,. Peter..

Chicago, IL 60611. gcarmona@chicagoreader.com. To Mr. Ken Lay,. I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.. Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.. The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.. Sincerely,. Godfrey Carmona

19649	2	SENDER START ted.murphy@enron.com SENDER END SUBJECT START Credit Story SUBJECT END Rick/Bill/David,. Generally, we have managed to keep our main counterparts transacting, but things are tight. We are signing netting agreements and agreeing to collateral threshholds, but we are negotiating hard where we think that we will be so close to collateral lines in the next few months that we would actually have to post.. As we go into this week, we need to hold on to those we have, incrementally open up a few more, and start to get people to business as usual. Amongst the things that continues to be missing are the OFFICIAL STORY (we have access to the newspaper here, too), good communication regarding global relationships,. and calendar and status of new developments regarding credit facilities, equity issuance/raising..... Not that some of it is getting through, it just comes through random channels and we know very little more than our counterparts that have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal. To that end, it has been suggested here that Houston (PR?) with RAC/Finance develop a daily script of talking points for the masses. We have traders and credit people talking all day to counterparts - they really could use a strong story to tell without have to think about it. I am very confident that I can tell a reasonable story myself, but I am concerned that I do not have all the facts at my disposal and my guess is that the average trader/credit specialist is probably at a greater disadvantage.. Thoughts?. Ted
190852	1	SENDER START mmolland@brobeck.com SENDER END SUBJECT START SUBJECT END This reports on our meet and confer session with the AG's office today. regarding the subpoenas served upon Enron Energy Services. Mike Kirby and I. spoke with Deputy AGs Margaret Wrighter and Paul Stein for approximately two. hours. These are the essential points we covered:. * Non-waiver of objections: They agreed that EES did not waive any. objections by attempting to negotiate compliance with the subpoena. They. will agree that any interim production of documents would not waive any of. EES's objections to the subpoena, except as to those documents actually. produced.. * Territoriality: We told them that EES would not produce documents. that resided outside the state. Much of the conference was devoted to their. disagreement with this position. Wrighter suggested that the AG may seek. prompt court relief on this issue or, in the alternative, file a lawsuit to. make EES a party in this litigation, then reach out of state documents. through ordinary discovery. We are at an impasse on this issue.. * Confidentiality: The AG proposes a confidentiality order identical. to the order in place between Reliant and Dynegy in their litigation with. the AG in Los Angeles. This order limits access to confidential documents. to less than 20 persons, but provides that persons outside the AG's office. at the PUC and other California governmental agencies may review produced. documents. The court in LA has recently ruled that the confidentiality in. place with Reliant and Dynegy and Mirant may be amended to permit the. offices of the Attorneys General of Oregon and Washington to review produced. documents, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the agreement.. Reliant and Dynergy are challenging this provision of the order in the. appellate courts, but have not obtained an order staying their production. under this order. The AG says they will not sign a different. confidentiality order with us. We did not agree to these provisions. We. are to give the AG a redlined confidentiality order on Monday that we would. accept in return for producing documents within California.. * Production of electronic documents: They insist that all documents. kept in electronic form be produced in electronic form. We discussed the. difficulties and burdens of doing this. They say they will insist upon this. requirement. We will consider compliance for electronic documents within. the state if it is not burdensome to do so.. * Confidentiality of customer contracts: They will agree to narrow. production to commercial customers. We explained that our commercial. contracts have confidentiality provisions with our customers. We told them. most have approximately a ten day notice period which we will honor. They. asked for an example of this provision, which I said we would provide. They. took the position that we should have been given notice to our customers. weeks ago and demanded production. We told them we would not do so until,. at the earliest, July 30, after we had given appropriate notice. They asked. that we begin to produce some documents before then.. * Interim production: We told them that, subject to an acceptable. confidentiality order, we were prepared to produce documents which were. reasonably requested by their subpoena that reside within California. beginning July 30, on the condition that it would not operate as a waiver. of any of our objections in later litigation. They said they would think. about this offer and call us back. Wrighter called back this afternoon,. saying that they wish us to continue with the plans to make an interim. production. She did not promise not to file a lawsuit in the interim.. Accordingly, we intend to prepare an acceptable confidentiality. agreement sufficient to protect the production of EES's California. documents, then send it to the AG with a letter that set forth the terms of. any interim production under that agreement. If they do not agree to the. confidentiality agreement, or the terms of the interim production, we will. not produce any documents. We will send this letter to the AG early next. week after we have distributed a copy for your review.. =.

Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are. sharing data from workshops). Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops. for them. Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the. multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the. different business units. Upcoming:. Additional workshops for EECC and ESA. Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made. available (and subjects they would like to cover). Will complete the ""user"" guides with screen prints to give out to all. participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips). Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22). Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review. Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:. Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new. content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a. scale of 1-4). The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is. still too low (average of 2.8). We will continue to analyze the root cause. of this problem.. There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules. contain which data. We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped. this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.. Comments received:. Very good and useful. Could have used this sooner.

Accounting changes spell $270m charge for Sears - Financial Times. Impatience and optimism on clearing - Euromoney. Basel gives banks the whip hand - Euromoney. Interest rate swap market opens up. Financial Times - March 22, 2001. By Janaki Ghatpande. Till about 12 to 15 months ago, the long-term interest rate swap (IRS). market was dormant for the lack of sufficient benchmarks despite the Reserve. Bank of India (RBI) permitting the instrument as far back as June 1999.. Ironically, in the last few weeks, there has been a spurt in IRS deals,. indicating a development of the market with increased sophistication in the. design of the products.. While swaps did take place in the past, most of them were short-term swaps. for durations between one to three months. Indeed, swaps of 12 months were. the longest available in the market. Bankers had earlier cursed the lack of. satisfactory benchmarks as holding back the market. The problem still. remains, what is different is the bankers have found innovative ways to. price longer term swaps. Now, the long-term interest swaps have gone up to. even five years.. In an IRS, two parties do a swap for a fixed duration wherein an exchange. takes place which is mainly notional. When bank rates fall, a player. reverses his position and books his profits. Thus, they receive a profit. when rates actually fall and vice-versa.. One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate for the tenor of the swap. while the other party agrees to pay a floating interest rate. This floating. interest is usually fixed on a benchmark from the debt markets which could. vary from the Mumbai Interbank Overnight Rate (Mibor) or a synthetic rate. derived usually based on a poll of market dealers.. ""The hindrance with these swaps is that the benchmarks for them are few and. far between. While some benchmark is on one-year interest rate taken from. the Reuters page (poll of dealers), some use the one-year T-bill average. yield against which the fixed rate is determined. Therefore, the increase in. the number of interest rate swaps provides more bench marks than were. available initially,"" said a senior dealer with a foreign bank.. Says Tarun Mehrotri, treasurer, HSBC, ""As a part of its broader strategy of. providing customised and risk management and funding solutions to its. clients, we provide interest rate swap prices benchmarked on both short-term. rates such as Mibor, CP rates and long-term rates such as one-year T-Bills,. government security yields. This provides clients the flexibility of. choosing the benchmark that best suits their balance sheet needs and. addresses their particular asset/liability management requirements."". ""It is primarily a customer-driven and a customised market which is designed. for the corporate keeping in mind their asset liability management point of. view. It is still not monitored. Therefore it is difficult to come up with. an estimate about the volumes,"" said an analyst with a foreign bank.. ""A swap can be important tools for banks and corporates who want to hedge. themselves against conflicting interest rate movements,"" he added. In the. market place currently, the average size of swaps is between Rs 25 crore and. Rs 50 crore.. Even the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India.

Morgan Securities India Private Limited.. Swedish PM not sure of EU financial reform accord.. Reuters - March 22, 2001. By Jan Strupczewski. STOCKHOLM, March 22 (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said on. Thursday he doubted whether reforms to create a single European financial. market would be approved at this week's EU summit in Stockholm.. The reform is key to meeting the 15-nation bloc's self-imposed deadline of. integrating its capital markets by 2005 to boost the competitiveness of. European firms through the same easy, cheap access to funding enjoyed by. U.S. rivals.. ""I am sorry to say I am not confident at all. But we will try hard,"" Persson. told a news conference on the eve of the summit, which will review progress. made by the Union towards its goal of becoming the world's most competitive. region by 2010.. ""We want to go ahead with it... I hope we will be able to gather not only a. majority but also unanimity for the reform,"" he said.. EU finance ministers are due to meet later on Thursday to discuss the. reform, prepared by a team led by former central banker Alexandre. Lamfalussy.. The Lamfalussy team proposed earlier this month that the EU should adopt a. ""fast tack"" procedure under which framework laws could be swiftly enacted,. leaving details to be filled in later by a new European Securities. Commission.. But the proposal has sparked power struggles between the Union's. institutions and met with resistance from Germany, which fears that its. financial centres could be subjected to looser regulation modelled on. London.. Swedish Finance Minister Bosse Rinholm, who will chair the Thursday evening. meeting devoted to the Lamfalussy proposals said agreement on the reform had. reached 99 percent.. The meeting will start at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) and be followed by a news. conference, the Swedish EU presidency said.. COMMITMENT IN DOUBT. Failure to back the proposals would cast doubt on the EU's public commitment. to an integrated capital market and could further hit the already battered. common currency.. The euro's launch in 1999 created a European capital market with a common. denomination, but the market remains divided in many areas by national. securities laws and accounting practices.. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have opted to remain outside the euro for the. time being.. The financial plan forms part of a wider agenda, laid down by EU leaders. last year, to make the EU the world's most competitive place to do business. within a decade. The March 23-24 summit is due to review progress towards. that goal.. ""It is of particular importance that the creation of a common market for. risk capital and financial services will be implemented according to the. timetables agreed,"" Persson wrote in a column in tabloid Expressen on. Thursday.. The task facing the finance ministers is to stop the issue from snarling up. the summit.. The debate turns on the seemingly arcane point of how a new European. Securities Committee would be able to block detailed legislation in areas. such as issue prospectuses and insider trading, proposed by the European. Commission.. Credit derivatives pose unexpected risks, says Moody's head of OTC. Risknet.com - March 21, 2001. By John Ferry. Credit deterioration rather than actual credit default could trigger credit. default swap contracts under current International Swaps and Derivatives. Association (ISDA) definitions, according to a new report by Moody's. Investor Service.. Moody's contends that ISDA'S current definition of a ""credit event"" is. broader than the general market understanding of default.. ""ISDA'S current definitions... could, in some cases, increase the risk of. loss by triggering payouts for events that are not actually defaults,"". contended Jeffrey Tolk in his report, 'Understanding the Risks in Credit. Default Swaps'.. ""Under a credit default swap, losses to investors are determined. synthetically, based on credit events occurring in a reference credit. Thus,. investors' risk is driven largely by the definition of credit events in the. swap,"" he added.. Credit default swaps are bought as a form of insurance against the risk of a. bond-issuing institution defaulting.. The report states that a restructuring of debt to defer principle payments. may not technically be a default if the lender has been properly. compensated, although ISDA would define this as a credit event.. Under ISDA'S definition of ""obligation acceleration"", a credit default swap. investor might suffer a loss although an investor in the underlying cash. position would not.. ISDA, which is the leading market association for the derivatives industry,. has set up a committee to look at credit derivative trading practices, in. particular credit event definitions.. Moody's said it is difficult to value defaulted credits to determine the. amount of loss to investors under a cash-settled credit default swap.. ""Calculated losses may vary based on liquidity, market conditions and the. identity of the parties supplying bids,"" the report said.. There is also a moral hazard problem associated with credit default swaps,. which arises as it is the buyer of protection that determines when a loss. event has occurred and how much loss is imposed on the counterparty. The. buyer has an incentive to be over-generous in loss calculation and to define. a credit event widely, Moody's said.. The expanding credit derivatives market is increasingly gaining the. attention of regulators. In a speech made two weeks ago, David Clementi,. deputy governor of the Bank of England, said he was concerned that market. participants may not fully understand the transactions they have entered.. Watch derivatives, warns bank. Euromoney - March 2001. David Clementi, deputy governor at the Bank of England, says the use of. credit derivatives in securitization poses a threat to capital market. stability.. In the closing address to the International Bond Congress in London,. Clementi surprised borrowers, investors and bankers with his concerns at the. rapid growth of credit derivatives and ABS markets, which many banks hope. compensate for the shrinking returns in bond trading and underwriting.. Clementi said there was a danger of a lack of transparency in the market,. because of the increase in the use of synthetic CLOs, where the risk. attached to loans and bonds is sold on -without a sale of the assets.. ""These markets mean that a bank need no longer remain exposed to its main. customers but can rapidly take on large exposures to other credits without. any new borrowing by the underlying entities,"" he said.. Clementi said it was a major challenge for authorities such as the Bank of. England or the. Federal Reserve to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of. securitization and derivatives in collecting financial statistics.. He also fears not all investors understand securitization. ""Some. participants in this market may not fully understand, or may have differing. understandings of, the transactions into which they have entered,"" he said,. adding that uncertainties remain about how courts in different countries I. will treat covenants and agreements in credit derivative deals.. The case of LTY Steel illustrates his concern. LTV is battling Abbey. National in the US over ownership of assets securitized in a deal. The judge. appears to favour LTV though Abbey National says it will appeal if it loses.. Investors, because of this risk, have to make sure they have conducted due. diligence, said Clementi.. The merging of the lending, securities and insurance markets raised new. risks, he said, adding this risk was particularly evident now due to the. debate over whether restructuring of debt constitutes a credit event,. thereby triggering a credit default swap. This row was sparked when Conseco. restructured its debt late last year. The International Swaps and. Derivatives Association has convened meetings to try and find agreement on. this question.. The British Banking Association has predicted that the credit derivatives. business will triple from $586 billion in 1999 to $1/581 billion in 2002..

Sears, Roebuck & Company, the second largest US retailer, said on Wednesday. it plans about $270m in after-tax charges this year due to accounting rules. changes.. The charges will stem from the retailer's adoption of a new Financial. Accounting Standards Board rule on companies~ accounting for use of. derivatives and hedging instruments. Sears detailed the move in its annual. report filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.. FASB amended rule No. 133 requires that all of a company's derivatives be. marked to market, valued and recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or. liability. Under the rules, the fair value of the derivatives, which could. range from futures contracts to complex swaps transactions, may be. calculated according to earnings or in ""other comprehensive income"" provided. certain conditions are met.. In that case, derivatives' gains or losses would be measured against the. value of the item that is subject of the hedge on the income statement.. The new accounting rule became effective for all fiscal years starting after. June 15 last year. Sears said it plans to use the new rule starting in the. first quarter this year. As a result it expects to take a cumulative $270m. charge this year. The transition to the new accounting standard includes. recording a $56m cash flow hedging relationship on the balance sheet and. reclassifying deferred losses from terminated interest rate swaps which. amount to $389m. Combined, they are estimated before taxes at about $175m.. The company uses debt and interest rate derivatives and currency hedges to. manage its risk. Much of Sears' profit comes from its credit card arm.. Sears also said in the filing that it expects about 5 per cent operating. income growth and at least 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year.. Impatience and optimism on clearing. Euromoney - March 2001. By Jonathan Brown. London hosted the first worldwide conference of central counterparties last. month to discuss developing a system of seamless global clearing.. The conference was initiated by the Depository Trust and Clearing. Corporation of the US.. Sir David Walker, senior adviser to Morgan Stanley International,. underscored the importance large securities firms attach to this: ""There is,. I believe, a general recognition that the capacity to clear and settle. trades has not kept pace with the capacity of trading platforms to attract. liquidity and handle trades,"" he said. Without serious thought to improving. clearing and settlement, the present infrastructure will not be able to cope. with large increases in volume and trading.. Representatives of central counterparties from the US, Asia and Europe. discussed procedures for operations and risk management, the benefits of. greater cooperation and legal ramifications. All believe there are. advantages to be gained from the more effective use of collateral in the. systems as well as netting which reduces the amount of settlement that needs. to be handled. Referring to efforts to integrate regional clearing and. settlement systems in Europe, Walker said: ""Far greater benefits will accrue. if the CCP and netting arrangements of these new vertical structures are. designed in an inter-operable,. open architecture way.. Jill Considine, chairman of DTCC, was pleased with the progress. ""We've. covered the landscape and gained some very important perspectives on. enhancing CCP capabilities, including the views of regulators, exchanges, as. well as the views of our colleagues at other central counterparties around. the world,"" she remarked. ""And we heard from our customers, telling us how. impatient they have grown with what they view as slow and piecemeal changes. in the industry's infrastructure. We must not lose sight of what the. customers value most - strong risk management, low costs and the stability. and reliability of a seamless infrastructure."". Basel gives banks the whip hand. Euromoney - March 2001. By Michael Peterson. It has been a long and exhausting labour of love. Between zoo and 300 bank. regulators from the wealthy G10 countries have flown many thousands of miles. and held countless hours of meetings. The Basel Committee on Banking. Supervision, which meets under the auspices of the Bank for International. Settlements (BIS), has spent the best part of two years rewriting the rules. on bank capital.. The committee, chaired by New York Federal Reserve president Bill McDonough,. steered the discussions. But the bulk of the work was done by four major. sub-committees. Each sub-committee set up working groups to look into some. detail of the proposed rules. The biggest sub-committee, the capital task. force, spawned no less than half a dozen subcommittees of its own.. The proposal document, released on January r6, is suitably massive. Its 541. pages outline a new world order for bank capital which looks, at first. glance, like a vast improvement. on the 1988 capital accord. Where the old agreement sketched out crude. guidelines for calculating the amount of capital a bank needs, the new. proposals delve into the gritty intricacies of collateral haircuts, clean. break' securitization, materiality thresholds and granularity scaling. factors.. Given the Herculean efforts of this dedicated band of officials, it seems. churlish to suggest that the proposals are flawed. But serious doubts are. emerging about the general direction the committee has taken.. The central element of the new rules is that big banks will be allowed to. set their own capital using internal calculations of risk. The regulators. expect a good number - perhaps 60 to 80 institutions - to be doing this soon. after the new accord is introduced in 2004. But Avinash Persaud, State. Street's head of global research, reckons the trend towards greater reliance. on bank risk management systems is a dangerous one. ""It is a dereliction of. duty by the regulators,"" he says. ""There is no industry with a longer. history of being unable to control its own excesses.. Flawed accord. The need to update the present rules is pressing. Simplicity was the great. virtue of the 1988 capital accord, but it was also the big weakness. The. accord established guidelines for calculating bank capital, with a basic. minimum requirement of 8% and weighting adjustments reflecting the riskiness. of assets. Members of the BIS then agreed to introduce these as the basis. for national law. The rules have quickly become the standard for other. regulators too, driving up levels of bank capital in many emerging markets,. for example.. The present rules apply a series of weights to the basic 8% capital number. for different assets on banks' balance sheets. Supposedly. risky assets,. such as loans to corporates and asset-backed bonds, are weighted at 100%.. Debts to countries that are members of the Organization for Economic. Cooperation and Development (OECD) are considered risk-free: they are. weighted at 0%. Exposures to banks based in OECD countries count as low risk. assets and are weighted at 20%.. The bank then has to hold capital equivalent to at least 8% of its. risk-weighted assets. And at least half of that capital has to be in the. form of so-called tier-one capital - chiefly equity and reserves. The 8%. figure is a mini-mum. National regulators are free to impose higher levels.. The Federal Reserve, for example, prefers big US banks to hold 10% capital.. The accord's crude system of asset weightings creates some perverse effects.. It means banks based in OECD countries can get much cheaper funding than. those outside the OECD club. This is not necessarily a good thing for. countries that join the OECD. State Street's Persaud points out that the old. Basel system produces regular ""OECD membership crises"". After they were. admitted to the organization during the course of the 1990's Mexico, the. Czech Republic, Poland and Korea all experienced economic booms fuelled by. suddenly cheaper credit. A year or so later, each boom promptly turned to. bust.. Under the 1988 rules, a junk bond portfolio with a heavy concentration of. telecom names is weighted at 100%. Fair enough. But a diversified loan book. of high-quality corporate names is rated at exactly the same level. Banks. know the Basel weightings produce a distorted picture of their true risk,. and many have become adept at finding ways to reduce their regulatory. capital, using tools such as securstization and credit derivatives. Others. have played the system for all it is worth, stocking up on risky, but. low-weighted assets.. ""The old regime had broken down because of the complexity of what the large. and sophisticated banks were doing,"" says Oliver Page, director of complex. groups at the UK Financial Services Authority and a member of the Basel. Committee. ""It was leading to capital arbitrage and we could no longer be. confident that the resulting capital matched the risks they were actually. taking."". Dynamite in the draft. The Basel Committee's first thoughts on revising the capital accord were. mostly about re-jigging the problematic risk weightings. A discussion. document released in June 1999 proposed a series of refinements to the. original risk bucket method. The number of risk weighting bands would be. increased and the OECD link would be scrapped. But what better measure of. credit risk could be used? The committee proposed a controversial solution:. weighting assets according to their credit ratings from the private sector. rating agencies.. The idea of incorporating credit ratings into the accord created a few. misgivings. For one thing many borrowers, especially in Europe, are not. rated. Some also worried that borrowers would cherry-pick the most. favourable ratings. The agencies themselves were not overjoyed at the. proposal. They quibbled over what they saw as inconsistent application of. their ratings from one asset class to another.. The 1999 proposal didn't stop at refining the weightings. It introduced a. couple of new ideas. One was that banks should be charged for operational. risk - the risk of things like system failures and rogue traders.. But the real dynamite came half-way through the 62-page document. The. committee conceded that a small number of very big, sophisticated banks. might be allowed to bypass the whole standard weightings process altogether.. They would be able to set their own capital requirements - in consultation. with their regulator using their own models of risk.. Risk modelling has become a growth industry in recent years. Big banks argue. that they can now model and manage their risk in a highly sophisticated way.. Their models give them a detailed picture of the risks inherent in their. business and the amount of capital they need to set aside for those risks.. Usually, the models say banks need to carry less capital than they would. using the standard risk-weighting method.. Between June 1999 and the end of 2000, as the committees and sub-committees. met to thrash out the details of the new system, the internal-ratings based. approach grew into the biggest part of the proposals. And no longer was it. only the very biggest banks that would be allowed to use internal models.. Now, any decent-size bank could aspire to calculating its own capital needs.. ""The big change from our June 1999 paper is that we have designed an. internal-ratings based approach that a good number of banks should be able. to apply,"" says the FSA's Page. ""In June 1999 we just talked about applying. it to some sophisticated banks. But over time we expect a major share of the. banking system will be on the internal-ratings based approach."". It is not completely clear why the committee decided to apply the. internal-ratings based approach more widely. The official line is that a. large number of banks have demonstrated their capability in risk modelling.. But some close observers reckon the committee was under strong pressure from. some European authorities - particularly the German representatives - to. allow a lower threshold for the internal models approach.. The new proposals talk about three approaches to setting capital. The. simplest, the standardized approach, is an extension of the present system,. but with risk buckets now linked to credit ratings. A triple-A sovereign. carries a 0% risk weighting. Single-A sovereigns, double-A corporates and. triple-A supranationals are weighted at 20%. Most loans with a B in their. rating fall into the 100% bracket.. There are also two new weightings. Single-A corporates and triple-B. sovereigns fall into a 50% band. A few risky assets, such as single-B. corporates, carry a 150% weighting. Where a borrower has two ratings, the. lower rating will be used to prevent cherry-picking.. The internal-ratings based approach divides into two different methods:. foundation and advanced. Both approaches allow banks to calculate their own. risks. In the foundation method, the regulator supplies some of the. parameters for the model. In the grown-up version, banks get to do all the. calculations.. The internal-ratings based approach should have several big advantages over. the simpler method. It should dramatically reduce the scope for regulatory. arbitrage, since the differences between a bank's economic capital - the. capital that reflects its true risks - and its regulatory capital will be. too small to bother about.. The internal-ratings based method also has much steeper charges for the very. riskiest assets. Under the standardized approach, the highest risk weighting. is 150%. But under the internal models approach, an asset could carry a 625%. weighting. (In other words, for every dollar at risk, the bank would set. aside 50 cents of capital, assuming it was aiming for 8% risk-weighted. capital.). But how can we trust banks to set their own capital? The authors of the. proposals give two reasons. First, the regulators will not simply sit back. and let the banks do their own thing. In fact, they will need to step up. their efforts to supervise banks, recruiting teams of savvy analysts to pore. over the banks' calculations.. Second, the market will police the system. One lengthy section of the. proposal - known, for no particularly good reason, as pillar three requires. banks to disclose to the market information on their risk exposures,. risk-management strategies and credit risk mitigation techniques.. ""We are moving towards a world in which the regulators step back and allow. the market to police itself,"" says Mark Intrater, London based managing. director at consultancy Oliver Wyman. ""If a bank reports its risks and the. market doesn't like it, that bank will have a hard time getting funding on. favourable terms and its stock price will drop. The world is not ready for. that yet, but this is a step towards it. Markets will always be able to move. faster than any regulations that could be drafted."". Disclosure - or what one analyst, in attempt to catch the mood of the. moment, calls the ""Big Brother"" part of the proposals -is designed to. prevent banks abusing the internal-ratings based approach. ""If we can get. market discipline to work then it won't be the capital regime that drives. the amount of capital banks have, it will be market pressure,"" says Page.. ""We see this already. Because of market pressures, banks already hold. materially more capital than we set as their minimum.. Using banks' internal models to calculate capital may be an attractive. solution to the tricky problem of how to regulate large and sophisticated. banks. But the approach is open to several lines of criticism.. Some say the banks' own models are not all they are cracked up to be. Stare. Street's Persaud says that banks do need risk-management systems, but the. ones they use today are imperfect. ""These marker-sensitive risk-management. systems all have the same philosophical flaw,"" he says. ""They assume that. every bank is acting independently: they assume that when they sell, there. is a marker to sell into.. In other words, they understate the real riskiness of panicky, illiquid. markets. ""The use of banks' internal models can be a problem,"" agrees. Standard & Poor's analyst Tanya Azarchs, ""to the extent that everyone starts. to use the same kind of models to determine the credit risk of a loan. If. that model is false-signalling it could cause real problems when everyone. heads for the exits at the same time.. What's more, greater disclosure might exacerbate the problem of what Persaud. calls herding. ""We are going down the wrong path in insisting on more. disclosure,"" he says. ""Every crisis follows a boom. This tells us that the. crisis is not about a lack of information. It is not about some domestic ill. that the right risk management system could have told us about. The cause of. the crisis lies somewhere in people's collective loss of sense during the. original boom."". Persaud believes the right approach to preventing crises is to encourage. contrarian investing. ""We need heterogeneity,"" he says. ""We need lots of. different types of investors playing lots of different types of markets with. lots of different strategies and risk management systems. This emphasis on. transparency is encouraging more herdlike and less contrarian behaviour.. This is why markets are becoming ever bigger in terms of turnover but ever. thinner in terms of liquidity."". The proposals may discourage contrarianism in other ways too. Use of. internal credit models may exacerbate natural economic cycles by encouraging. banks to lend heavily in the good times and cut back on credit when the. economy turns down depressing ratings.. For example, as the US economy has stalled in recent months, bankruptcies. have risen and credit ratings have fallen. Banks' internal credit models. presumably show the same decline in asset quality. Under the. internal-ratings based approach, banks' risk-weighted assets would now be. increasing and their regulatory capital requirement would be going up. That. would encourage them to freeze new credits. In times of rising credit. quality, the reverse would apply, perhaps fuelling a boom.. Another criticism of the banks' internal models is that they are not. conservative enough. S&P's Azarchs thinks banks' own capital models award. them too much benefit for the diversity of their portfolios. 'Banks'. internal portfolio models suggest they could run on as little as half the. capital they have now,"" she says. 'We don't believe that is the case. We. don't think there is excess capital in the system. If this proposal winds up. decapitalizing the system, that would be very concerning.. For now, banks would not be entitled to a capital reduction purely on the. grounds of credit diversity, although this is something that the Federal. Reserve has hinted could be introduced later. As a result, the banks'. calculations of regulatory capital will still typically come out higher than. their calculations of economic capital under the internal models approach.. Unrealistically short maturities are another problem with banks' own models.. ""Most banks' internal models assume a hold rate of one year or less,"" says. Azarchs. ""That is one reason their internal models show a capital surplus."". She believes the advanced internal-ratings based approach falls into the. same trap of underestimating maturities. The foundation version of the. internal-ratings based approach assumes that all loans have a maturity of. three years a reasonably cautious assumption. But on the advanced approach,. banks will be able to plug the legal maturity of loans into their capital. calculations.. Azarchs thinks this would be a mistake. ""We don't think this is the right. way to think about it,"" she says. ""A loan has nothing to do with its stated. term, it is representative of a relationship. As long as things are going. well, one expects the loan to be rolled over."". If the capital models give recognition for short legal maturities, banks may. simply extend short loans and roll them over. Banks would employ the same. kind of capital arbitrage they do today when they extend 364-day credit. facilities: such loans are designed to benefit from the zero risk weighting. of undrawn loans with a maturity of less than one year.. National pride. Another worrying aspect of the new models-based approach to bank capital is. that it will mean different things to different regulators. In a way this is. no different from the situation with the current capital accord. But at. least the 5988 version has the virtue of being simple enough for the most. backward regulator to understand.. ""Were not sure that all national regulators are equipped to supervise the. internal-ratings based approach,"" says Azarchs at S&P. ""There would. probably be an incentive for all of them to vet a few of their largest banks. right out of the gate - on the assumption that these big sophisticated banks. must know what they are doing."". National pride might also sway some regulators to treat their charges. leniently. ""There is still scope for significant discrepancies in the way. these proposals are implemented, particularly in pillar two [supervision],"". says John Tattersall, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London. ""Very few. regulators will want the embarrassment of deciding that their major banks. are short of capital."". So what is to stop a regulator letting a few of its banks graduate to the. internal-ratings based approach even when their risk management systems are. nor up to scratch? ""The idea of a completely level playing field is an. unreachable goal,"" says Page at the FSA. 'But we will have processes to try. to ensure there is a reasonably even-handed treatment across the G10. This. will not be some kind of central policing. It will involve being open about. what is going on in each others' countries and feeling free to comment.. Market forces act as another constraint. If a supervisor is known to be a. soft touch, the banks under its supervision will be penalized in the market. place."". Some large banks are privately worried that their own regulators will apply. the new rules more harshly than supervisors in other countries. The. disclosure requirements in the proposal are another big source of concern. for some of them. ""The committee seems to have taken a kitchen-sink approach. to disclosure,"" says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""Everything that. might be desirable seems to have been included."". But Page at the FSA appears to offer some hope that the disclosure. requirements will be watered down. ""You need a fair amount of information to. make the internal-ratings based approach work,"" he says. ""The disclosure. requirements we have proposed are desirable, but we also need to be sure. they are cost effective for banks. It may be there are better ways of. arriving at the same results. I certainly hope banks will give us good. feedback on this point.'. The Basel accord is only supposed to apply in the Gin countries, but some. observers have begun to think about the impact of the proposals on the rest. of the world. ""Basel was never designed for emerging-market banks,"" says Ian. Linnell, an analyst at Fitch in London. ""But in reality it is adopted by any. banking system that wants to be taken seriously. And the idea that riskier. entities should hold more capital is definitely one that should apply to. banks in emerging markets."". He believes the proposals could have some unintended consequences in less. developed banking systems. ln practice, most emerging market regulators will. adopt the standardized version with some modifications. Others will stick. with the current version of the accord -something they are perfectly. entitled to do. ""We will end up with four different methodologies for. calculating bank capital - the 1988 version of Basel, the standardized. approach, the foundation internal-ratings based approach and the advanced. internal-ratings based approach,"" says Linnell. ""Add the salt and pepper of. charges for things like operational risk and you have a recipe for. confusion. The whole concept of a minimum level of tier-one capital could. become relatively meaningless."". Time to collect data. One key uncertainty in all this is how many banks will use each of the three. new ways of calculating capital. The consensus at the moment is that a. minority of banks - but a. majority of banking assets - will quickly move to using internal models.. ""My sense is that in 2004 about 40 banks around the world will adopt the. foundation approach immediately and that maybe two or three will go straight. for the advanced approach,"" says Azarchs at S&P. Within half a decade, the. best part of too institutions could be setting their own capital.. That means banks need to start crunching a lot more data. ""The timing is. tight,"" says Tattersall at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""Banks need to start. collecting the data next year in order to have the necessary three years of. historical data by 2004."". In order to use the foundation version of the internal-ratings approach,. banks need to input reliable data for every asset's probability of default.. If they want to graduate to advanced, they should also be able to make. assumptions about loss severity or recovery rates. ""The internal-ratings. based approach looks great in theory,"" says Linnell at Fitch. ""But there is. a real problem with the quality of data. Banks may have a reasonably good. handle on probability of default, but it is very hard to get hold of data on. recovery rates.. Up until now, banks have been surprisingly poor at keeping consistent. records on how many of their borrowers have defaulted and how much of a hit. they took as a result. Even the most rigorous institutions are hazy about. some areas of their business. ""Most big, sophisticated banks have rating. systems for some loans that would pass regulatory muster,"" says Intrater at. Oliver Wyman. ""But they also have categories of special loans that are. managed in a less sophisticated manner. It is simply the difference between. using a system for internal management purposes and using it for external. reporting purposes."". Clearly, banks will need to improve their record keeping. It has been widely. suggested that this scramble to put new systems in place will increase the. pace of banking consolidation. Smaller banks, it is assumed, will not be. able to make the necessary investment in technology.. On the other hand, bank mergers have often made it more difficult to get. systems in place. According to Azarchs at S&P, Canadian banks have some of. the best historical data in the world. This is because Canadian institutions. have been prevented from merging. US banks, by contrast, often find it. difficult to reconcile data from a number of legacy systems.. One widespread assumption so far has been that smaller banks will ignore the. internal-ratings based methods and stick with the standardized approach. ""A. lot of small, specialist retail operations will - quite appropriately. -ignore everything beyond the standardized approach,"" says Intrater.. But the internal models approach could yet gain a momentum of its own. If. internal models are successfully used by as many as 6o or 8o banks to reduce. their capital requirements, smaller banks may want to join the party too.. This will certainly be the case if the technology and expertise needed to. use the approach become relatively cheap commodities.. ""Perhaps one or two banks might develop a certain way of doing. internal-ratings based measurement and start to franchise that procedure out. to smaller banks,"" suggests Raj Malhotra, credit analyst at Goldman Sachs in. London. ""Smaller banks might be willing to pay for that."". Just as the original Basel accord was soon adopted much more widely than it. was originally intended, so the internal-ratings based approach could become. the standard for any bank which aspires to international respectability.. Once the floodgates of internal capital calculation have been opened, they. may not be easily closed.. Power to the regulator. If that happens, a lot of regulators will need to learn a whole new set of. skills. There are broadly two approaches to bank regulation. The first. involves laying down the rules and checking that banks comply with them. The. second, often called bank supervision, is more intensive: it involves making. individual judgements about each bank's risks and appropriate levels of. capital and continually checking that banks are playing it safe.. The FSA is proud of its record in bank supervision. ""In the UK we have. recognized for a long time that there is no way to collect all the. information you need, put it through some number cruncher and come out with. an answer for the amount of capital a bank needs,"" says Page. ""There are. areas where judgement is required in forming the answer.. The Basel Committee proposals have quite a lot to say about banking. supervision - or, in Basel-speak, pillar two. The proposal exhorts. regulators to review banks' internal capital adequacy assessments and to. intervene early to stop a bank's capital falling below the level appropriate. to that bank's risk characteristics.. But this level of supervision will be much harder for some regulators to put. in practice than others. And it is not simply that some regulators are smart. and others are dullards. ""Regulators such as the Federal Reserve have the. advantage of a relatively small number of large banks to manage,"" says. Intrater at Oliver Wyman. ""Others, such as the Office of the Comptroller of. the Currency [which regulates smaller US institutions], supervise a large. number of small banks. They will need a much larger staff of supervisors.. Some observers have the feeling that the more clued-up regulators, notably. the Federal Reserve and the FSA, are getting too far ahead of their less. sophisticated colleagues. ""A lot of national regulators lack the powers to. go in and do this kind of pillar-two supervisory control,"" says Azarchs at. S&P. ""In addition, they may not have the experience or the staff to do it."". Is it realistic to expect all regulators to supervise their banks in the way. set out in the proposals? ""Not all supervisors will suddenly set. differentiated requirements for all banks,"" says Page at the FSA. ""But I. would expect that they will look at some of the bigger ones and at some of. the outliers."". But the Basel Committee can't force countries to invest in creating powerful. and expert regulators, even though this is exactly what the internal-ratings. based approach requires.. ""These proposals appear to give greater powers to the market but in some. ways they do the opposite,"" says Linnell at Fitch. ""Regulators will need to. set key data inputs and supervise the entire internal-ratings based. approach. That will increase the burden on regulators. Many are not going to. have the people or expertise to cope."". The big uncertainty of the Basel proposals lies with the capabilities of the. world's bank regulators. Much of the epic work they have written makes good. sense. But when the new accord is implemented in the real world, it will -. like the 1988 accord before it - take on a life of its own..

It appears that they have. only made the one change that is highlighted. However, I would request that. we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other. changes which are not highlighted. Vlady - here are some thoughts on your. comments.. 1 - Stop limit size. I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change. this at this point. Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.. As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless. unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.. 2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination. period of each fiscal year.. 3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.. The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a. different notification at the higher threshhold. It does not need to be a. formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary.. 4 - The VaR language you provided has been incorporated as Appendix IV.. Overall, there have not been many changes. I would like to get final. comments, subject of course to Peoples changing their minds on something, as. soon as possible. My goal is to execute this policy the first part of next. week. Let me know if this is practical.. Thanks,. Gregg

Settle This. Which technology resolves disputes best?. March 20, 2001 issue. Michael Grebb. St. Louis retiree David Hubert couldn't have been happier to score a replic=. a. of a $3,000 Charles Eames leather chair on eBay -for only $450. When it. arrived, he tore open the box, pulled away the bubble wrap, and immediately=. . sunk into the chair to ease his bad back. ""As soon as I sat in it, I could=. . tell...whoa, this isn't right,"" he says. ""It had a bad mildew smell-I mean,=. a. really bad mildew smell."" Distraught, Hubert emailed the seller to demand=. . that he either pay to clean the chair or take it back. The seller refused.=. . ""He basically stonewalled me,"" Hubert says. So Hubert filed a grievance wit=. h. SquareTrade, a San Francisco-based startup that helps resolve disputes on=. . eBay.. A SquareTrade online mediator-a real person who corresponds with both parti=. es. via email-immediately began negotiations. After a week of back-and-forth, t=. he. seller finally agreed to send Hubert $150 to have the chair cleaned. Hubert=. . and the seller never were in contact. ""I think it went really smoothly,"". Hubert says.. Mediation has been a popular alternative to lawsuits to resolve disputes,=. . especially those involving small amounts of money. For businesses, conflict=. s. between state and international laws have made dispute resolution costly, n=. o. matter how big the transaction.. With $657 billion changing hands through Internet transactions worldwide, i=. t. comes as little surprise that a raft of new dot-coms plans to move the. mediation process further online. Everyone expects online mediation to grow=. . as the number of transactions conducted online continues to grow. ""Regardle=. ss. of the market fluctuations and a fair amount of blood on the street,. ecommerce is here to stay and is growing at a steady pace,"" says Steven. Abernethy, president and CEO of SquareTrade. ""There is wealth of commerce=. . online to keep us and others busy for a while."". The American Arbitration Association estimates that dispute resolution is a=. . $200 million-a-year industry, but there's no way to know how much of that=. . would migrate online. ""I'm not sure it would necessarily shift,"" says. association spokesperson Toni Griffin. ""Online transactions may simply. generate more disputes, which would grow the whole market."" American. Arbitration-the largest dispute resolution company with 140,000 cases per=. . year as of 1999 and $65 million in annual revenue-recently announced its ow=. n. online mediation business.. Online mediators agree that easier dispute resolution will drive faster. adoption of ecommerce by businesses and consumers, many of whom may now avo=. id. online transactions for fear of getting hosed. According to Forrester. Research, two-thirds of businesses say they would not conduct an online. transaction with a party they don't already know.. What they can't agree on is how to use technology to resolve disputes. Some=. . companies, such as SquareTrade, eResolution, or Online Resolution, have had=. . experience resolving disputes. They are mediating disputes online simply by=. . substituting an online chat session or email for the conference table or. telephone. But a few upstarts say these companies aren't harnessing new. technologies that allow mediation to be automated.. ""This is not as simple as slapping up a Website,"" sniffs Charles Brofman,=. . president and CEO of Mount Kisco, N.Y.-based Cybersettle.com. He doesn't. mediate disputes but offers an automated blind bid system to negotiate. settlements when liability has already been established. Here's how it work=. s:. The aggrieved party enters a demand; the liable party enters the most it wi=. ll. pay (Neither side sees the other's entry, hence the term blind bid.) If the=. . numbers are within 30 percent of each other, the software automatically. splits it down the middle and settles the claim. For each dispute, the. parties get three tries, after which they must start over if their entries=. . still haven't come within 30 percent. The company says the site can handle =. as. many as 10,000 simultaneous sessions per second.. Brofman says he has signed insurance companies to flat-rate subscription. plans in which Cybersettle offers discounts for a certain number of claims=. . per year. ""This system just takes all of the ego and personality and whittl=. es. it down to what it should have been-settling the claim,"" he says. That's. especially important, he says, for international disputes in which cultural=. . differences can muddy an otherwise objective claims process.. Rival clickNsettle.com offers a service similar to Cybersettle's, but doesn=. 't. limit parties to three bids per cycle. Instead, it uses a monetary. disincentive to stop parties from gaming the process. ClickNsettle doesn't=. . set a bid limit, but charges a small fee for every settlement offer made. C=. EO. Roy Israel says the fees are just annoying enough to keep parties from. wasting bids on outlandish demands. ""It eliminates the ridiculous,"" he says=. .. ""It keeps someone from asking for millions of dollars. It causes people to=. . get real-real quick. No one wants to waste $100 on bids that don't go. anywhere."". Israel criticizes Cybersettle's three-bid process, calling it inflexible. because it ""artificially terminates"" the process even when parties haven't=. . settled. And as you might expect, Brofman is equally skeptical of. clickNsettle's unlimited bid system. ""If you go to infinity, people just tr=. y. to game the system,"" he says. ""And once insurance companies realize you can=. . game the system, they're not going to use it."". His clickNsettle.com was called National Arbitration and Mediation for eigh=. t. years before adopting a dot-com moniker last year. ""We're not just an. Internet startup trying to capitalize on dot-com hysteria,"" Israel says.. ""We're a mediation business evolving into a Web-enabled business."" In fact,=. . its existing mediation infrastructure allows the company to give users the=. . option of moving disputes offline if necessary.. The question is whether either Cybersettle or clickNsettle-or any of the. other mediation sites-will catch on. ""I'm skeptical of these automated. mechanisms,"" says Forrester analyst Charles Rutstein. ""It's a little too. 'Let's-let-the-machines-do-it.'"" He wonders whether all the messaging. back-and-forth makes sense for many disputes that could be easily settled=. . using traditional means. ""Just pick up the friggin' phone,"" he says..
